## RGVIA 400-1-1473: О включении Бухары и Хивы в таможенную черту и об устройстве таможенного надзора в Закаспийской области Ч.1. 16/06/1891 - 17/07/1897. approx. 800 folios. MF.

This is a colossal Delo, consisting of 4 microfilms worth of documents. However, it is not clear that it in fact goes all the way to 1897 (as noted in the opis' notes), and the vast majority of it is from 1893. (Therefore, better to check published materials before investing too much time.)

## Timeline from Seymour Becker, Russia’s Protectorates in Central Asia: Bukhara and Khiva, 1865-1924 (Harvard University Press, 1968).

- "In __1887__ Minister of Finance I.A.Vyshnegradskii proposed the inclusion of Bukhara in the Russian customs frontier, but the foreign ministry, as anxious as ever to preserve Bukhara’s autonomy, successfully opposed the idea. In February 1891 Vyshnegradskii revived his suggestion" (119).
- "Lessar presented his solution to the problem on April 7, __1891__, at a conference in St. Petersburg of members of the finance and foreign ministries, presided over by Vyshnegradskii. The political agent proposed that the customs frontier be moved to the Amu-Darya regardless of the opposition of the emir or his subjects, but that Russia compensate the Bukharan population for the consequent rise in the cost of living" (119).
- "The Ministry of War wanted the customs unification worked out completely and then presented to Abd al-Ahad by the governor general of Turkestan, but a second conference, meeting under Vyshnegradskii’s chairmanship on June 15, 1892, did not agree. Instead, in January __1893__ the government took advantage of the first visit of a reigning emir of Bukhara to Russia to inform Abd al-Ahad of its plans" (120).
- "On June 6, 1894, the project was approved in its final form, and the Bukharan government was informed of the terms... Abd al-Ahad had no choice but to accept the fait accompli, and on July 24 the kush-begi officially notified Lessar of the emir’s consent" (120).
- "The inclusion of Bukhara in Russia’s customs frontier, effcctive from January 1, __1895__, did not establish a customs union between the two states. Bukhara continued to collect the traditional zakat on imports from Russia, and instead of a uniform tariff on the Bukharan-Afghan border, there were actually two tariffs, the Bukharan zakat and the standard Russian duty" (121).
