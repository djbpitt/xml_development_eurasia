## O brozhenii bukharskaro dukhovenstva napravlennom protiv russkago vliianiia v Bukhare (RGVIA 400-1-4000). 24/06/1911 - 20/10/1911. 45 folios.

Most of this Delo is concerned with Russian urging of the Emir to dismiss anti-Russian members of the ulama (especially Ghias al-Din, the Alam); in the [[final report|RGVIA 400-1-4000, ll. 44-45b (156)]], Alim agrees to do so (having previously agreed to, and not followed through), but it is never clear if he actually goes through with firing the anti-Russian clergy.
