Transcluded series. Khivan Madrasa Cell Dispute; discussed in Pickett, "Enemies beyond the Red Sands: The Bukhara-Khiva Dynamic as Mediated by Textual Genre."

General description: 

After three days the denizens of that madrasa / guzar went to the Qazi Kalan to report that Mulla Abdallaev was behaving like a madman.  They petitioned the Qazi Kalan to vacate his cell. They were worried that they would fall under suspicion for taking his belongings from his cell, so they put a lock on his door.

Zarif Bay of Khiva, former holder of the cell, had died, which meant his cell should go to his heir.

So the office of the Qushbegi ordered that the police take the cell from Mulla Abdallaev and give it to Mulla Muhammad Karim of Khiva: بعملدار پلیسۀ تحت دروازه امر نموده حجرهً مذکوره را خالی کنانیده
