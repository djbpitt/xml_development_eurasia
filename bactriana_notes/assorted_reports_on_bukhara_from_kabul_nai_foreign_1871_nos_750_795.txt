Then the Meers said that four of them would go to see the King, and the Goobernatt also intimated his wish to accompany them; but the Meers stated tha, as their people are unscrupulous, there was danger lest any injury should happen to him whereby both they (the Meers) and the King bight be disgraced, and the intention was abandoned.  The Meers recieved *khilluts*, and the Russians being much gratified with them, permitted them to return to their homes.  On Monday an agent on the part of the above Meers waited on the King with a letter, and said that the Meers had told him to communicate to His Majesty that the Goobernatt had expressed himself satisfied with him (the King), and that he would, therefore, proceed towards Kokan; also, that the Meers were pleased with the Goobernatt..."
