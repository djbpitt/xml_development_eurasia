## Mohan Lal, Travels in the Panjab, Afghanistan, & Turkistan, to Balk, Bokhara, and Herat; A Visit to Great Britain and Germany (London: William H. Allen & Co., 1846).

Kabul

- In Kabul: "May 8 to 17. - I had the pleasure of talking with Mr. Wolff, who came into my room, and told me to listen to the Bible, and be converted to Christianity, whih is the best religion in the world.  My answer pleased the reverend gentleman very much.  He added the following most singular seech: - That in the City of Bokhara he had an interview with Jesus Christ, who informed him that the pleasant valley of Kashmir will be the New Jerusalem after a few years" (72-73).
- Language in Kabul: "The people and the merchants of the city generally speak Persian; but in the country, a very harsh Pashto continues to be spoken" (73).
- Hindus: "The Hindus are nearly two thousand in number, and many of them are the first inhabitants of Kabul... Their shops are spread over all the streets and bazars, while their Mohammedan neighbors, though they are prejudiced against them, treat them very tolerantly" (74).
- Trade w/ Bukhara: "The caravan of Lohanis, which consists of between six hundred and seven hundred camels, furnishes it once a year with English and Indian goods.  They come through Multan and Ghaznin, where they are not ill-treated.  Great part of their merchandize is conveyed to Bokhara, which furnishes the merchants in return with fine silk, and also with a good breed of beautiful horses.  These fine animals, purchased in Kabul, are sold in India at a price, quadruple their original cost, surpassing the expectations of their first Uzbeg masters" (76-77).

The road from Kabul to Bukhara

- @@important@@ - Lal places the border between Afghanistan and Turkestan just after Bamian: "May 24. - As soon as the sun shone, we commenced our journey, escorted by Haji Khan's people, who were all well armed and mounted.  Our route conducted us betwixt the lofty branches of the Hindu Kush, ascending over large ranges and descending into deep defiles, all without verdure, and of dreadful aspect - not a single tree appeared in sight.  Having crossed the pass of Akrabad, the height of which is 10,500 feet, we quitted the boundary of Afghanistan and entered Turkistan" (90-91).
    - (cont.) The first town in Turkestan: "Our march, which was not more than thirty miles, brought us to the beautiful town of Saighan, ruled by Mohammad Ali Beg.  His object is to attack, or chapao, the villages of Hazara, and reduce the inhabitants to slavery" (91).
- At the caravan stop of Haibak: "The caravans of Bokhara and Kabul, which pass here on their route, are obliged to pay very heavy duties.  A market is held on Mondays at Haibak.  The Hindus are also shopkeepers; the language they speak is Persian, and they look very like the Muhammedans" (95-96).
- "This country is called Turkistan, but the Qizal Bashis of Kabul have named it Kafristan, or Country of Infidels, on account of the slave-trade.  The inhabitants are Turks, or Uzbegs" (98).

Qunduz and Khulum

- Mir Murad Beg ruled Khulum from Qunduz: "Mir Murad Beg, the ruler of the country, is in person short and thin; he has very small and gloomy eyes, and no regular beard, only a few hairs on his chin.  He is an Uzbeg, which signifies, in Turki, an independent, and also the king of his own house.  He is said to be unacquainted with justice and mercy, those ornaments of human nature" (99).
    - "His standing army is a few hundred men, but in time of war he can collect nearly twenty thousand, both horse and foot, each selected from separate families" (99).
    - Boundaries: "Towards Kabul he rules as far as Kamard, and towards Bokhara, to the kotal named Abdu.  His residence is at Qunduz, and in that direction he commands a large territory in Badakhshan, and also the base of the Hindu Kush" (99).
    - Relationship with Bukhara: "he is a more enterprising man than his father, who was dependant on Bokhara; but his death made the name of Murad Beg so famous in the country, and his power so much respected by the people, that in a short period he was recognized as independent chief of Qunduz, and almost of the whole of the rich valley of the Oxus.  He possessed himself of more countries than any of his predecessors had" (99-100).
    - "Atma Ram, a Hindu inhabitant of Peshawar, who stands very high in Mir Murad Beg's favour, possesses a great influence over him.  He bears the title of Diwan Begi, or the prime minister.  The whole business of the country is managed through his intervention.  Notwithstanding he adheres to all the customs of the Hindu religion, and is partial to his countrymen, yet he is respected by all Mohamedans, and none venture to throw a slander on his character.  Being a man of distinction, he keeps a great number of Mohammedan slave-girls and boys, which privilege is not allowed to any other Hindu in Turkistan" (101).
- Characterization of religion in Khulum: "Disputes respecting religion are a frequent cause of tumult among them; but although they are not acquainted with one word of its tenets, they are so bigoted, as to pretend to be strict observers of the Mohamedan faith" (105).

Bukhara and environs

- "Qarshi is larger than Khulum. The buildings are much better than those at Balk... The place is celebrated for god tobacco and sweetmeats.  The great bazar is not neatly roofed, and canals run through every place; but few of them contain water. Numerous gardens filled with trees form a boundary to the town within which all wealthy classes reside; mechanics and tradesmen live in huts under the trees" (121-122).
    - "The people are Uzbegs, and are computed to be nearly 13,000.  They are all of the Sunni sect, but do not attend strictly to the laws of religion... The men who are affected with leprosy are not allowed to touch anybody, and are generally exiled" (122).
- In Bukhara: "June 29 - An early walk led me through the bazar called Sarafan, where I observed two Mohammedans mounted on camels, guarded by four sepoys, who had only whips in their hands. They were ordered to be scourged by the Qazi for not saying their morning prayers and for sleeping after the sun was up. This sort of occurrence happens every day at Bokhara, and the punishment is publicly inflicted.  Some are chastised for smoking, some for drinking, and others for snuffing: these practices being prohibited by the law of Mohammed.  The guilty person, mounted on a camel, calls out in the following manner: **This is th epunishment for a person who does not recite his prayers.  He who will smoke shall suffer like him; snuffing is the cause of the distress which he endures now patiently.** The Qazi, who is said to be guilty of some misdemeanors himself, has no power to seize the criminal in his own house, because the Qazi uses his authority according to the following proverb: **the Qazi is of no use in the house.** The Hindus smoke in the caravansarae, which privilege is not allowed to Musalmans.  I was surprised at the foolish prejudices of the bigoted Mohammedans of this country, who prohibit smoking tobacco, but allow it to be sold publicly" (126-127).
- Ablutions in Bukhara: "They never wash themselves with water, but clean themselves with a piece of clay.  If any man dares take water, either according to the custom of his own country, or from a regard to cleanliness, he is consdiered by the Sunnis to be an infidel, or Kafar Qizal Bash" (128).
- Veiling: "They are covered with a gown from head to foot, and have a black thin veil, which sometimes they lift up in the streets, and pretend that none have seen them.  They bind a white turban upon a handkerchief, which conceals their head, and hangs as far as their waist.  The bad women are called jahab or qatah.  The present king enforces more strictly than his predecessors the outward observance of morality" (128).
- Bukhara population: "The population of the city is 170,000 souls" (129).
- Kingly power: "Notwithstanding his authority is limited by the law of Mohammad called Shariat, yet he rules sometimes according to his own will.  It is very odd that his arbitrary power is praised by every person, with numerous good wishes for his life" (130).
- Illness: "The climate of Bokhara is healthy.  The people are not subject to any disorder, except the guineaworm, or rishtah, which molests them much.  It is like a thread, and springs up from every limb of the body; sometimes it breaks into pieces, and obliges the sufferer to linger in bed for four or five months, during which time he undergoes the most terrible pain" (131).
- Drug production: "Tobacco and rice, though cultivated at Bokhara, are not so good as in Qarshi.  Opium is planted here abundantly, and also mulberry trees" (132).
- Visiting a madrasa: "July 13 - I paid a visit to the college at noon, and had a long altercation with the Maulavis in Persian. They were of course in possession of knowledge, but had not a good pronunciation.  Every person at Bokhara had a greater desire to write well than to acquire learning. They examined me, and then said, **Allaho Akbar! how is it possible that a Kashmerian at such an early age should be versed in a science of which the Mohammedans at Bokhara are destitute!** One of them, who was older than the others, spoke civilly to me, and said, if I would be an Uzbeg, I should indeed be the Plato of the time" (133).
- Sovereignty of Nasrallah: "... the king has now obtained a degree of glory which was never enjoyed by his predecessors.  The chiefs of Sabzshaihar, Samarqand, Balk, and Qarshi, do him homage for their possessions" (134).
- "Bokhara is the largest and most populous and wealthy city in the whole region of Tartary.  The splendid mosques and magnificent colleges, which are 360 in number, contain students who are unqualfied both in the Persian and Arabic languages, but they write a very good hand" (136).
- Power of poetry: "July 17. - Maulavi Babajan, who became my great friend, desired me to call at his house, where he had prepared a rich dinner fo me.  When the entertainment was over, we began to read poetry, which my host liked very much.  Before I left him, he presented me with a Koran, and his wife with a cap made of silk" (137-138).
- Army: "It is said that the king of Bokhara has 20,000 troops, which are mounted on swift horses... It is alleged that the king may collect 100,000 soldiers from the villages, in a time of great danger; bu tthey might be routed by 10,000 regular troops" (138-139).
- Treatment: "We have been respectably received and civilly treated, though we can scarcely call it kindness... for we were all looked on as Kafars, and were not permitted to ride in the city.  Like other infidels, we were obliged to submit to be distinguished by a peculiar dress: this is a black cap, and a rope round the waist" (143).
