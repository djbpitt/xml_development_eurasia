## Hafiz Muhammad Fazil Khan, The Uzbek Emirates of Bukhara & Khulum in the Early 19th Century as described in an Indian Travelogue: Tarikh-i-Manazil-i-Bukhara, trans. Iqtidar Husain Siddiqui (Patna: Khuda Bakhsh Oriental Public Library, 1812).

Translator's Introduction (i.e. by Siddiqui)

- Khulum: "The three kingdoms that an European invader might face on his way to India were (i) the kingdom of Bukhara, (ii) the Principality of __Khulum__ (sandwitched between Afghanistan and the kingdom of Bukhara, comprising the parts of Balkh and Badakhshan territories), and (iii) the kingdom of Afghanistan" (4).
    - The ruler of Khulum was Mir Qulij Ali Beg (6).
- The expedition party of 1812: "Saiyid 'Izzatul1ah was accompanied by two other persons, Hafiz Muhammad Fazil Khan, an India Pathan of Bareilly town (Western Uttar Pradesh) and Sarfaraz Khan, son of Mulla Abdul Samad, the Mufti (Jurist) of Bukhara. On their entry in Afghanistan the envoy, Saiyid Izzatullah was detained by Bahadur Khan (the governor) in the fort of Attack. Thereupon, his companions had to proceed on their journey without him" (5).
- Characterization of Bukhara: "Unlike Alexander Burnes and Mohan Lal, Fazil Khan appears to have been highly impressed by the socio-political system that he witnessed in the Muslim states of Khulum and Bukhara. The Bukhara society uuder Mir Hyder Ali is protrayed by him as an ideal society" (7).
    - "The author glows with joy and pride wlien lie describes the judicial system based on the Islamic Sharia' which treated every person equal irrespective of birth or creed... Religious divines (ulama) commanded great respect in the society and students were looked after properly. The state and rich people endowed property to the madrassas (col1eges) for their upkeep" (7).
- Author of the source portrays the Bukharan army as a formidable force, despite the fact that "It makes it clear that the anny organization did not undergo any change since the 16th century" (8).
- Health systems: "The only important thing that our author found wanting in Bukhara was the hospit11s maintained by the state as well as the availability of expert physicians" (9).

#### The Travelogue

Chapter 1

- Balkh is subservient to Kabul: "The 26th stage is from the city of Balkh, lying in the western direction, inhabited by Uzbeks and Tajiks and held by the governor, Najib Ullah Khan, posted by Muhmud Shah, the King of Kabul" (13).
    - But Khulum is definitely not: "Inside the border of Kbulum under the government of Mir Qulij Ali Beg there is neither the fear of the robbers and highwaymen nor Sa'ir taxes (numerous taxes on animals) are collected. In Balkh which is governed by Najib Ullah Khan, appointed by his Majesty, Mahmud Shah, the King of Kabul, tax cannot be collected owing to the interference and objection from Mir Qulj Ali Beg" (17).
- A desert separates Khulum and Bukhara; apparently, Bukhara controls the Oxus itself: "The entire track is a waterless desert, forming the boundary between the territories Qulij Ali Beg and Mir Haidar, the king of Bukhara. Both of the banks of the river Oxus and the boats availble there are under the charge of Mir Rahim Ali, the son of the uncle of Mir Haidar, the King of Bukhara" (16).
    - "There are no hillocks and fortresses between Khulum and Bukhara" (18).
- Territory between Khulum and Bukhara is very dangerous: "People may, however, travel through that track when they are in caravan and sufficiently laced with weapons. If the party of the travellers is small and without weapons, they can pass through safely in two ways; first, (by chance) they do not meet the highwaymen on their way, (2) they employ people of the Ghilja clan on wages to be their guides" (16).

Chapter 2: Account of the boundaries of the Country of Mir Qulij Ali Beg, the ruler of Khulum

- Description of the ruler of Khulum: "Mir Qulij Ali Beg is sixty years old but vigorous, fair-complexioned, having a reddish face. He has only a few hairs of his beard on the chin and they are all white. He has short eyes and wide forehead. He wears Uzbek dress" (20).
- The Amir would go to the bazaar personally to inspect weights, look for fraud, etc. (20).
- Khulum has a Hazara population: "There is the village Zubki in the south of Khulum, inhabited by Hazara people who profess Shi'i fai'h. Most of the road upto the vicinity of the village, Iqrabad, the dependency of Butbamiyan (Bamiyan) in the Kabul Kingdom is infested with the Hazaras (robbers) who attack and pillage the caravans proceeding to Kabul or Kbulum" (21).
    - The Amir captured and enslaved many of these Hazaras (21).
- Interesting - the Mir's son governed Balkh for the King of Kabul: "The Mir has got thirteen sons. One of them Ahmad Beg, aged 20 years was his eldest son. He was the governor of Abik on behalf of His Majesty Mabmud Shah, the king of Kabul. His title was vali of Balkh. The annual income accruing from the BaUch canal that amounts to 70 thousand rupees was granted to him by Mahmud Shah, the King of KabuI. He passed away all of a sudden towards the close of the year 1802 A.D. As half of his body became blue after his death, he was supposed to have been poisoned by some enemy" (22).
    - After the son died the King of Kabul "However, the government and administration is carried on by Mir Qulij Ali Beg in the territories of Balkh and Khulum. The hakim of Balkh does not enjoy any power" (23).
    - "The revenue of Balkh is not sent to the king of Kabul. But the hakim 'of Balkh sends present, consisting of horses, etc., every year. Sometimes, Mir Qulij Beg sends cows and Turki horses as gifts from a friend to Fath Khan, the Wazir (prime Minister) of Mohammad Shah, the king of Kabul, for Painda Khan, the father ofFath Khan Wazir had don~ Mir Qulij Khan some favour in the past" (23-24).
- Governance: "The army men are not paid their allowances in cash but land has been reserved for them" (22).

Chapter 3: The Boundaries, Divisions and Officers in the Emirate of Bukhara

- Haydar appoints his sons as governors to various cities, but he also appoints slaves (25).
- The significance of mir vs. bey: "The title of Be or Mir is conferred upon the chiefs (officers). Be is higher in importance than Mir. Therefore, the Wazir ofMir Haider Padshah is (called) Hakim Be. Even the name of the father of Mir Haider Padshah is known in that country as Shah Murad Be. Mir Haider Padshah is called Mir on account of his noble origin. The noblemen and officers, great as well as small in the personal service of Mir Haider Padshah are known as Mir Koh" (26).
- Has a list of the goods that are traded back and forth between Kabul and Bukhara, as well as Herat and Kashgar (27).
- Minorities - Hindus and Jews: "The Shikarpuri Hindus go to Bukhara in connection with trade alld some stay there for six months while others spend the whole year and rom back to Kabul and Shikarpur after they had done their business. No Hindu owns a house in Bukhara. All the Jews (of Bukhara) own one thousand houses in a settlement near th~ gate of Salah Khana (magazine), in the city of Bukhara. They are engaged in the trade of silk, the work of dyer, carpentry, slaughtering and selling meat" (28).
- Description of Haydar: "The title held by Mir Haider, the Padshah of Bukhara, is Bahadur Khan. He is thirty-five years old, tall and a good looking young man of red and white complexion. His face has turned yellowish on account of his religiosity and piety; he observes fast on alternate days throughout thc twelve months of the year, and spends night in vigil, and administers justice daily. He has a beard. He wears an Uzbeki cap on which. he wraps (First) the Uzbeki turban resembling the Arabs' head-dress and then a strap of (another) cloth" (29).
    - Maternal sayyid descent: "The mother of Haider Padshah of Bukhara is of Saiyid origin" (29).
    - Haydar's piety: "This (present) King gets up at midnight and offers namaz-i tahajud (mid-night prayer), and then remains busy with reciting the names of God till moming. Having offered his early morning prayers he imparts lessons to forty-five students on the hadith (tr:Jditions uf the Prophet). Thereafter he sits in the hall on a throne covered with green velvet. He always remains on his knees (in siting posture)" (29).
- Courtly ulama: "In the royal assembly the Saiyids and the ulamas (scholars) sit on the right hand of the king. The saiyids sit near the king and then ulamas sit on their left..." (29).
- Court Shariah law: "All the petitioners sit before the king without much distance between them. Everyone of them submits his petition to the king, the latter having enquired into the matter dictates the order according to the book (Islamic law). There are a few bound books on fiqh (Islamic Jurisprudence) placed on the throne. In the afternoon, five or six distingushed scholars join the king and then discussion is held about matters relating to science and knowledge. The king not only listens to them, but also takes part in the discussion" (30).
- Royalty and shrine visitation: "The king stays with his mother in the house at night on Tuesday. In the morning, on Wednesday he goes on foot to the shrine of his holiness Baha-ud-Din Naqshband, and having offered prayers [on his grave] comes back on a horse and enters Bukhara distributing articlcs [moncy, etc.] in charity" (31).
- "The second brother, whose mother is one of the descendants of Khwaja Ahrar, resides in Shahr-I Sabz and the hakim of [the place is] Niaz Ali Be. Mir Haider, the king, sends him his maintenance allowance from his own pocket. The said hakim is in rebellion against the king of Bukhara" (31).
    - *huh? so the king's brother fled to Shahrisabz but the king sends him money anyway?*
    - "The cause of the arrival of Husain Khan in Shahr~i-Sabz, is that he was the hakim of Samarkand at the time of Mir Haider's accession to the throne. As he refused to pay allegiance to Mir Haider, the king having been informed about his conduct, deputed an army for setting him right" (32).
- Note that the author also describes Kokand as temporarily in rebellion: "He was in rebellion against the king of Bukhara. He was unjust, oppressive and a tyrant" (31).
- What does "rebellion" mean?  "Likewise Niaz Ali Be, the hakim of Shahr-i-Sabz and Saiyid Be the hakim of Hisarll are in rebel1ion against the king of Bukhara. But both of them always send their envoys with gifts and letters of submission to tbe King of Bukhara. Haji Firoz-ud-Din, the vali of Herat, also sends his envoy to the court of Bukhara" (33-34).
- Shifting symbols of royal legitimacy: "Since Mir Haider, the king is of gentle nature, Hafiz of the Quran (one who has committed the Quran to memory), and a just ruler known for his piety, religiosity and sound scholarship, he __had the word Padshah (king) removed__ from his coins. In all nobility and high minded ness, he had Amir-ul-Mominin (for him) struck on the coin instead" (34).
- Everyone is armed: "In the whole of the country of Turkestan every man, smaIl as well as high, ties a scimitar to his waist. Some persons have one dagger while other carry two daggers. In short nobody is found without a dagger" (34).
- Womens' clothing: "The ladies wear a short coloured silken head cover made in Bukhara which does not come upto their breast. Their garments are like those of men. They wear shoes and slippers made of dressed sheep skin which is covered with banat of black colour [woollen cloth] with embroidery work. Some [ladies] wear [shoes] simply made of dressed sheep skin with no banat at all. They put on tight trousers and come out from their houses with a black sheet of cloth covering them" (35).
- Author is very impressed by the number and size of the __madrassas__, reporting that some even have up to three hundred hujras (38).
    - "There is (at least) one teacher for every branch (of learning) in the madrassa, and two students live in one room. The founder of the madrassa having purchased several bighas (acres) of cultivable land and few shops, endowed them for the maintenance of the teachers and the students" (38).
    - Non-waqf salaries: "In addition to (this income) the King also gives an annual cash grant to every madrassa. The King rather pays the prominent teachers every month (at different rates) five tilas to fifteen til as" (38).
- Has some interesting information on physicians in Bukhara, how most of them are of poor quality, and on the legal proceedings for indicting quacks (39).
- Author's note: "In the month of April, 1812, Saiyid 'Izatullah Khan, the servant of the government of the Company of Angrez Bahadur (the English East India Company) proceeded to Bukhara on the persuasion of Nawab Muntazim-ul Daula, Mukhtar-ul Mulk; Charles Hafles, (Mr) Metcalfe Sahib Bahadur and Sahib-i Wala-Manaqib (Mr.) William Moore Kraft Sahib Bahadur" (40).
