## i-126 / 2 / 6100 (May 1917)

Russian and Persian correspondence between Resident in Bukhara (conveying info from consulate in Kashgar) to Qushbegi.

f. 4-4b: "M.I.D. Rossiiskoe Rezidentstvo v Bukhare 25 Maia 1917"

- Russian consul in Kashgar informed the resident that their senior trader in Yarkend (торговый старейшина) that Sa'id Khodja Mohammad Ruzybaev, a native of Bukhara, died and left behind some property (f. 4).
- Requesting that the Qushbegi order an investigation (справка) to see if he has any living descendants in the place of his birth (4-4b).
- If there are any descendants, they should personally go to Kashgar or send a representative to collect the effects (4b).

f. 3: Persian letter - 4 June 1917

- Bukharan chancellery response to former.
- Also uses the Russian suffix to refer to the end of Sayyid Khwaja's name: سید خواجه محمد روزی بایف
- Sent someone to ask around amongst the merchants (سوداگر) from that region.
- Not true that he left behind a widow or heir: حقیقت نماند که از متوفی متروکه مانده گی بوده است 
- Bukhara indeed ordered an investigation as requested, but could find no evidence that he was from Bukhara: از رعیه گان بخارا سید خواجه مذکور را نمیدانیم و از کدام گذر بخارا بودن آن بخط تعیین نشده

i-126/2/6072

- This is a very similar case, except on Igamberdy Mansur Khodjaev dies in Kashgar itself.  Qazi Kalan's office replies that they cannot find any of his heirs.
