Darwaz and Karateghin, by Mr. Arendarenko.  From the *Russian Military History Journal* for November and December 1883." (1).

On Darwaz:

- Origins of population: "We are able to gather that they have given shelter to the aborigines of the valleys of the Oxus and Jaxartes - the ancient Persians of the cult of Zoroaster - in periods of foreign invasion, and to the remnants of the hosts of Alexander of Macedon; these have preserved the tradition which has conferred upon them the appellation of Shah-Aulad-i-Iskandar, or rulers of Alexandrian descent" (3).
- (cont.) "Being so isolated and suffering poverty, Darwaz, and in a measure Karateghin likewise, were in some degree in entire dependence on the neighboring Bokharian and Kokand Bekships, a circumstance which involved them to some extent in the frequently occurring agitation in Central Asia, and which partially had an influence on their destinies.  We know from the remote past that Darwaz was for several years under a governor, Kirghiz-Khan, appointed by, and the natural son of, the enterprising conqueror and able administrator Abdullah-Khan, Khan of Bokhara (1538-1597).  Kirghiz Khan gave the name of Kaloi-*Khum* (pot) to his capital residence (pai-takhta), probably because he found there an enormous pot carved in granite, which, it is said, had been the work of the coadjutors of Alexander of Macedon, who sought shelter in the *zindani* of Hazret-i-Suleiman, as Darwaz is styled by the mountaineers, because of the inaccessibility and wildness of the country" (3).
- (cont.) Independence from Bukhara: "Darwaz having disappointed the expectations of Abdullah-Khan in respect to its mineral wealth, and to the Khan's project of opening a direct road to India, - he had already built brick caravanserais on the road to Badakhshan - soon freed itself from the Bokharian yoke, and until very recent times was governed by its own native *Shahs*.  This was the most brilliant period, while it was also the most turbulent, of the political life of Darwaz.  These native *Shahs* either openly usurped the power or seized the reins of government after destroying their rivals; party intrigues and internal feuds were incessant, and lately the oligarchy revelled at the cost of the weaker class, while the party of a rival pretender gathered strength to force their way up to the *arc* or citadel of Kaloi-Khum on the Nahvamin height, and to shout out **Come out *Shah*, we do not wish to have you any longer**" (3-4).
- The 19th century dynasty: "Passing over the political vicissitudes of Darwaz subsequent to Kirghiz-Khan, we shall only name the hereditary Shahs of the present century.  Muzrab-Shah (1812-1822) is the wisest of the Shahs in the memory of the people, he was succeeded by Shah-Turk (1822-1830), Ibrahim Shah (1830-1837), Sultan-Shah (1837-1845), Ismail-Shah-Ibrahim-Shahof (1835-1863), Shah-Darwaz-Ismael-Shahof (1863-1870), and finally Syradj-i-din-Sultan-Shahof (1870-1876)" (4).
- (cont.) Political history: "Under Ismael-Shah the Darwazis succeeded not only in reducing Karateghin and Shughnan to vassalage, but also in making Kulab and Hisar tributories to them albeit for a short time.  Endeavoring to extent his authority farther west, Ismael-Shah was taken prisoner by Sary-Khan, the hereditary ruler of Kulab, and Darwaz, besides losing Karateghin, was shorn of its best provinces along the Hing-Ab (Wakhia and Khulas).  Sary-Khan, after this victory of the Darwazis, established his authority over Hissar, Boldjuan, and karateghin, and the descendants of Ismael-Shah, in the endeavour to retain at least Central Darwaz, turned for protection to the Amir of Bokhara.  This policy, inaugurated by Syradj-i-din-Shah, brought him as a vassal to Shahrisabz with tribute (*tartuk*), and finally made him forfeit all independence; he was deprived of his title of Shah by Muzafer-Khan, and was consigned to a residence in a Bokharian citadel, while Darwaz with Hissar and Kulab (1868), and Karateghin (1869), were converted into Bokharian Bekship, and in the winter of the year 1877 were occupied, after a slight resistance, by a detachment of the Amir's trooops, under the General Khodoi Nazar Parvanachi" (4).
- (cont.) Present circumstances: "Darwaz is at present governed by a Bek, appointed by the Amir, named Murat-Bi, a man of great energy, who resided permanently at Kaloi-Khum, and who commands a garrison, consisting of one battalion of Bokharin Sarbaz, serving their term most unwillingly in the **Zundani,** which for half the year is deprived by snow of all communication even with Karateghin" (4).

On Karateghin:

- (cont.) Origins of name: "Karateghin is said to have been named after Kara and Teghin, two Kirghiz tribes of Kokand, which are believed to have been the first to have peopled the country" (4).
- (cont.) Independence: "All the traditions of the past history of this mountain region agree in showing that up to the year 1868 the dominions of Karateghin were independent, and constituted an oligarchy under hereditary Shahs.  But there were always numerous aspirants to power under such a system, both in Karateghin and Darwaz, there arose a feud and a struggle on the death of each Shah" (4).
- Political history: "In the year 1868, Sary Khan, the independent ruler of Kulab, endeavoured to form a military alliance with Karateghin with the view of protecting his territories from an anticipated attack on them by the Amir of Bokhara.  the Shah-Muzafer (of Karateghin) considered that it would be too hazardous to enter into such a compact, and sent Sary Khan's letter to the Amir of Bokhara.  Incensed by this treacherous act of his father-in-law, Sary Khan invaded Karateghin with a large force, and in a few days seized the whole country, capturing Shah Muzafer.  He had, however, to hurry back to Kulab, hearing that the Amir's troops were advancing in that direction.  Sary Khan had to relinquish his conquest, and exacting a promise of support, released Shah Muzafer and left Karateghin in his hands.  but very soon after, in the course of six weeks, Karateghin was occupied by a Kokand force under Shir-Ali-Pansad, and the troops of the Amir of Bokhara easily occupied Kulab.  Sary Khan escaped to Cabul, but Muzafer-Shah was taken as prisoner of war to Khan Khudoyar of Kokand" (5).
    - (cont.) "Nor did Shir-Ali-Pansad remain long in Karateghin.  On the approach of the Amir's troops, after the occupation of Kulab, to the fortress of Ab-i-gharm on the western frontier, the Pansad fled with his small body of troops to Kokand, following the same route by which he had invaded Karateghin, viz., by way of Kichi-Karamuk.  Karateghin was occupied by the Bokharians, and Mahommed Rahim Pshuk (pug-nosed) was appointed to the Government by the Amir. Since then, this large and comparatively rich portion of Kohistan has practically belonged to the Amir of Bokhara" (5).

Governance

- "The administration in Darwaz and Karateghin is organized as in all other Bokharian Bekships.  The whole of Darwaz is divided into six Amlakdaratres or districts, and Karateghin into seven districts with an Amlakdar over each, who are chosen from among the relatives of the Bek, and with a certain number of *Nukers* or mounted militiamen composed of notabilities of the country; these *Nukers* are not needed so much for any particular service as for the purpose of maintaining an influence over the population" (5).
    - "The *Nukers* in Darwaz, Wakhia, and Khulas number 600 on the rolls, and 4,000 men in Karateghin, the latter receiving only half the allowance of those of Darwaz, and their complement is being gradually reduced at the insistence of Khudoi-Nazar Divan Begi (Generalissimus) the Bek of Karateghin, who from motives of selfish interests wishes to increase the revenue.  This course in regard to the *Nukers* in Karateghin is fully justified by the complete pacification of the country; they have nothing whatever to do, and there is no longer any necessity to maintain them at a cost of three quarters of the revenue for the purpose of exercising an influence over teh population, but the Government of the Amir will not resolve upon the final abolition throughout all the Bekships of a numerous and not very useful contingent of old serving men, which dates from the time of Chingiz-Khan.  In Darwaz they cannot be done away with, because they serve as a medium between the populace and the foreign Government which can collect the tribute only by means of native officials" (5).

Religion

- "The natives of Darwaz and Karateghin are all *Sunnis*, but they re not very religious and pay little attention to their *Medressehs*, and contribute very little towards them.  The annual income of an Imam, inclusive of contributions (*fitiri-ruz*) during the *urazy* fast and *kurban-bairam* feast, hardly amounts to 20 rubles.  But he is aided by his parishioners in his field labours.  In Darwaz and Karateghin the youth meet in the *mesjids* to amuse themselves *gashtak* and pass the night there" (12).
- "The Kohistani is also true to his word.  He is very intelligent, has an excellent memory, and is very observant.  The young men from Darwaz and Karateghin surpass all their fellow-students in the *medressehs* of Bokhara and Samarcand.  The Kohistanis believe in spirits, such as the vengeful (*lägtor*) and the protecting spirit (*patakghor*), and are full of superstition" (13).
