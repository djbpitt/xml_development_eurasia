"No. 47.  Translation of Statement of a person send [sic.] from Peshawur"

- "Having started from Peshawur, I reached Bokhara in 65 days as well be seen from the accompanying list A of stages and halts, and put up in the **Serai** of Mulla Budroodeen with Atta Mahomed, a Bokhara merchant, who was kind enough to procure for me, from Samarcand, the purchases noted in list B."
- (cont.): "A few days before my arrival, the King of Bokhara had sent his younger son to Tashkund with one lakh of Tillas (one tilla equals 6 1/2 Rupees) and the Prince did not return during my stay in Bokhara."
    - [From subsequent page]: "The lack of Tillas forwarded by the king to the Russians were borrowed by him from the merchants, but he has now paid the debt."
- (cont) Trade conditions: "Since the Russians have taken possession of Tashkund and Samarcund, the import of piece goods from India has ceased, though the trade has not been forbidden by them.  If any merchandise fails to sell at Bokhra it is taken to Samarcund, but the profits realized are less than those relized before the Russians conquered the country.  The consumption of cloth goods in Bokhara has not decreased, and tea and indigo goods are also consumed in the countries conquered by the Russians.  Articles exported from Bokhara are taxed at the rate of Rs. 2-8 per cent on value.  (**Chil-o-ek**) in Tashkund, and the goods exported from the latter place are exempted from taxation..."
- "The people of Bokhara generally are displeased with the king, not only on account of his conduct* [footnote: **Explains that the King was already unpopular from seizing peoples** daughters and carrying them off to his zenana'], but also because of his having given up his country to the Russians without opposing them."
- (cont.) Geopolitics: "On my departure from Bokhara, the King was in Kurshee, and had sent his troops against Kulab.  The Meer of Shuhr-i-Subz, who was formerly on bad terms with the King, has now become his friend, the latter has therefore forwarded as a khillut ten thans of cloth together with ten horses to the former."
- (cont.) Military: "Sirbuland Khan, Afghan, who went to the King from Cabul, has entertained five Infantry Regiments for him which are called **Surbaz.**  There are 80 guns in Bala-Hissar of Bokhara, of which 30 lie on the ground, and 50 are on carriages.  Of these 50 guns, only 15 are serviceable, gunners, ammunition, &c., are wanting for the remainder."
    - "(*Volunteered*) The Bokhariots are not up to fighting, no use whatever, very inferior to the Afghans.  Their cavalry soldiers wear only a sword or knife, and the footmen flint-lock guns."
