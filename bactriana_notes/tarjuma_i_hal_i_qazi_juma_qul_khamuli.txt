Qāẓī Jumʿa-Qulī al-Mulaqqab bil-Khamūlī bin Sūfī Tughaī Turk al-Samarqandī


This is the autobiography of a qazi that lived outside of Samarkand in the second half of the 18th century (born 1190/1776-1777). It was composed in 1252 / 1836-1837.  None that while the [[Mirzoev catalog|Mirzoev and A. M. Boldyrev, eds., Katalog vostochnykh rukopisei Akademii Nauk Tadzhikskoi SSR]] goes with Kh__a__muli, [[Semenov|Semenov, ed., Sobranie Vostochnykh Rukopisei Akademii Nauk Uzbekskoi SSR]] went with Kh__u__muli; the Persian word "obscure" has a damma.  This manuscript is identical to pages 133b-183b of [[Tārīkh-i Khumūlī (al-Biruni 37)]]

1b

- Starts out the memoir by thanking God that he was saved from the ranks (از زمره طایفه) of the ignorant - specifically the ranks of the Turks.
- From the ranks of the ignorant he joined the ranks of the learned.
- Author is quoting the Koran about the Arabs who were brought into the ranks of Islam from ignorance; those remaining behind are a metaphor for the Turks.  بشرف فضل و ایقان متانه گردانید یعنی __از قبایل اتراک__
    - Once these Turks came in to the fold they were negligent in Islam: از اکتساب فواید دینی و اقتراب مواید یقینی تقاعد ورزیده 
    - Moreover: آدمیت را بغولی و عالمیت را بگولی بر گذیده
- درجات بمدارج علم عرفان ترقی نموده اند منخرط گردانید
- Sufi learning: درجات بمدارج علم عرفان ترقی نموده اند منخرط گردانید
- Makes some cryptic reference to a "third degree" of something or rather: (continuing on to next page) این موهبت درجۀ سیوم است از مئيد (مؤيد) قیاض
2

- Parable of Umar and Ali: Umar claims that he is stronger in faith than Ali: یا علی من لذّت ایمان را از تو بیشتر مییابم
    - Naturally, Ali asks "how do you figure?" Umar replies that his faith is greater because he was once an infidel: چرا که من زهر کفر را چشیده ام و تو نچشیده پس لذت تریاک اعظم را که ایمان است
    - Ali accepts this logic and agrees with Umar.
    - *It seems that, as a Turk, Khamuli had a bit of a chip on his shoulder, which here he turns to his advantage*
2b

- His learning has brought him wealth: این چگونه نعمت عظمی و عطیه کبری است که نعمت باطنی را در حق این محقر بنعمت ظاهری آراسته از فقر بغنا و از ذلّت بعزتم رسانیده
    - So not only is our author a Turk, he came from modest a background at that.
- Sources of authority - Fath al-Bari: این بندۀ مقصر بانجاز رسانده در کتاب فتح الباری بر شرح صحیح بخاری نوشته دیدم
- Names Hanifa as a Sufi: حضرت امام ابو حنیفه کوفی صوفی
- Quotes a sura about good works being rewarded by God - another self-serving metaphor.
3

- Goes on a bit about good works and grace in the afterlife, faith, etc.
- Knowledge is the source of all prosperity in this world and the next: پس اساس همه سعادت دنیا و عقبا علم باشد
- Khamuli's membership in a Sufi order of some variety seems rather clear based on his references to secret knowledge - کتمان، غیبت, etc.
- His Sufi credentials notwithstanding, Khamuli nevertheless elevates the Ulama:  و در کتمان نعمت و عیدها از صاحب شرعیت واعع است چنانچه علما دانند
    - i.e. the __ulama__ as a category have access to the secret knowledge of the prophet.
3b

- Makes a direct horse riding metaphor (illustrating his Turkish background) to express the necessity of using his learning for God's work.
- A cryptic reference to the four mothers (i.e. four elements) and the seven fathers: اجرای این نسخه را که نتیجۀ امهات اربعه و آبا سبعه است و بدستور موالید ثلث...
- At this point the author introduces his father whom he respects a great deal, which will lead into a story about the miraculous circumstances of his birth: والد ماجد... مرد صالح پرهیزکار
4

- Father eschewed doubtful food and drink (از طعام شبهه ناک نخورده ام)
- My boy, before your birth I witnessed a miracle: ای فرزند پیش از ولادت تو بر من حالی عجیب و غریب روی میداد
- Father was out wandering in the desert when he was hailed by amazing apparitions: اکثر در بیابان و در صحرا ها مردان عجیب بر من ملاقات میکردند و التفاتها و بشارتها میدادند
- The father would again see these apparitions in mazars and places of purity (جایهای پاکیزه).
- These meetings allowed his father spiritual insight and divine favor: و توفیق کامل داشتم
- His father, however, was an uneducated man and did not understand these signs: عجایب بسیار میدیدم و تأویل آنها را از جهت عامی بودن نمیفهمیدم
- Mysteriously, after sexual union with the author's mother and his conception the strange apparitions no longer appeared to his father: و ظهور اشخاص روحانی و ملاقات رجال الله بر من مثل سابق نمی میسر نشد و در باطن خود آثار شوق و وجد آن حلاوت را کمتر مشاهده نمود
- Which of course put the father into a depression... that is until a holy shaykh offered him an interpretation.
4b

- As it turns out, the holy apparitions witnessed by his father were all for the sake of his auspicious child: آن حالت و معاملات بو بوسطۀ روح او (ای فرزدت) بوده
- Khamuli was born in کندرود که از توابع معیون است in the year of 1190, سال گوسفند در اخرین فصل زمستان
5

- His father tells the good news of the miraculous birth to his friends: و این بشارت ها را بچندین نفر از دوستان صادق و یاران موافیق خود نیز گفته
- The friends witness and affirm the miracle and later told the author about these events, including the tale of the widow (discussed below).
- At this point Khamuli begins the tail of a poor, destitute widow caring for four orphan girls.
- When Khamuli's mother was pregnant this woman had a miraculous dream.  A piece of paper bigger than a carpet (کاغذ بکلانی بوریا بلکه کلانتر) fell from the sky.  The paper was full of various writing.  Everyone was watching and hoping that it would fall on their house.
- Author describes his house as خانه خيرگاه, suggesting that his family was living in a Turkish tent, though should check the term Khirgah.
5b

- As the paper entered the tent of Khamuli's parents it was miraculously lit up with light: و آن کاغذ از چنگ گیرک آن خانه فرود آمد بشعاع آن خانه و اطراف آن روشن شد
- Upon hearing the miraculous story of the widow, the father praises God and asserts that his son (Khamuli) will become an Alim: این پسر ما عالم میشود
    - And his followers will be prosperous: از برکت علم او تمامی اتباع ما بهره ور میشوند
- Khamuli is careful to constantly remind readers that these stories were relayed to him by others, i.e. he did not make them up himself.
- The widow told him these stories in the year of 1226 when he was residing in the ولایت اوره تپه in the village قریۀ میکده.
- At this point Khamuli begins a story of his own miraculous dream in which he witnessed heaven itself, just as has been relayed by the Ulama of Islam: اینفقیر در خواب خود بهشت را دیدم بوصفی که علماء اسلام از رسول انام علیه السلام روایت نموده اند
6

- Much of this page is a description of heaven as seen by Khamuli in a dream.
- This vision took place in the year 1252, (25?) years ago.
- Author writes that despite the passage of time he remembers everything he saw without alteration (بلا تغییر).
6b

- So overpowering is the vision that he rarely recites the ayat.
- In his vision of heaven he saw no women - only men made it there: از جنس زن اصلا ندیدم همه دردان بودن
    - *except* he did see the aforementioned widow in heaven, though he did not have the opportunity to speak with her because he woke up.  He is very upset about this fact (افسوس هزار افسوس که از عالم تمثال بعالم شهادت تنزیل نمودم).
7

- References the Ghazali book مشکواة الانوار
- Spends this page discussing a hadith about why women do not get into heaven and the importance of men educating them.
8

- Through this page he continues discussing the hadith about women and hell, offering and explanation.
- Origin of his name (جمعه) arises from the fact that he was born on a Friday morning, the most auspicious of days (سیّد ایّام).  The قلی part of his name is Turkish for slave.
8b.  *This is the page where the autobiography really begins*

- Interesting - Khamuli has a poem here about how he is proud *not* to be a Sayyid, but rather happy to be a slave of God: نی سیّدم نه هاشم نه قریشی  ام، فخرم همین بس است، که نامم غلام او است
- Claims that he can remember the events of his youth like it was yesterday.  سختی را که یکبار شنیدم کم فراموش کرده ام
- In his youth he was ignorant of ilm and the ways of the ulama, but held an internal faith: 
- Author had 6 siblings, 3 of which were older and all of which were literate.
9

- Therefore, his father ordered Khamuli to become a shepherd (شبان).  *Unclear why his father would have this planned for him after all the miraculous visions*...
- Thus by his thirteenth year never been to a maktab: تا بسنّ سنزده سالگی بمکتبی نفرستادند 
- Nevertheless, Khamuli possessed divinely inspired learning, so this was not a hindrance: امّا بتعلیم فضل یزدانی تعجب حالی داشتم
- His teachers were amazed at how quickly he could internalize his training; they could not understand where his knowledge came from.
- People were amazed that he could recite suras without knowing what an alif was: همه حیران میگردیدن که بآنکه نمیدانستم که الف چیست و باکدام این معنی مشهور شده بودم
- In the year 1202 he had memorized 1102 suras.
- Having completed this feat and having served his parents faithfully, he gained permission (اجازت) from them to continue in the maktab.  But it was tradition that the pupil go to the maktab and ask the Ustod for permission to train alone without the parents.
- Khamuli quickly surpassed his teacher in the basics (continuing on to the next page): بیک مرتبه تلقین استاد از الف تا با را احفظ کردم فهم استاد شد که من بیشتر میدانسته باشم
9b

- Continues to emphasize his miraculous skills: از اوّل سوره تا اخیر بیک نفس هجا نمودم, thus shocking his teachers: از حیرت نفس در گلوی استاد بند شد
- There were many witnesses who all testified that they had never before seen such a miraculously gifted youth.
- Borrowing books (از نسخۀ عاریتی که بدست آخوند مکتب بود تعلیم میفرمود) from the Akhund, Khamuli quickly passed through the ten degrees of learning: عدد سبق از مرتبۀ احاد بدرجۀ عشرات رسید
10

- Funny anecdote illustrating Khamuli's passion for learning -  Every day when the other children would go to the bathroom he would read their books while they were gone: فرصت بودم که کمام اطفال باجازت آخوند بصحرا میرفت تا از (چیزی) کتاب او سبق خوانم تا صاحب کتاب از حاجت بر گردد
- Khamuli left many other students behind in the first rank, so fast did he progress.
- The Akhund believed that Khamuli had studied with somebody else previously since he was so quick: فهم استاد این بود که سابقاً شاگردی کسی دیگری کرده ام
10b

- Suspicious, the Akhund would give him constant tests, but his knowledge was imparted by God: علی اللسان و الله علم رسیدم بدستور قدیم هر کلمه را که آخوند بیخواند من از خارج هجا میکردم
- One day Khamuli made a mistake in his recitation (هجا باعراب حرفی خطای از من واقع گردید) and the Akhund became very angry and punished him severeley.
- For the life of him Khamuli could not figure out the answer and hence remained silent, which pissed the instructor off even more.
- Simple verse describing the Akhund's sudden anger: هر چند فرشته بود دیو شد
- Despite 50 years passing since that day, Khamuli still tastes the bitterness of that lesson, though he values the consequence: آری جور استاد به ز مهر پدر
11

- When Khamuli received this beating from the Akhund, so loud was his cry that his parents came running and interceded.
- The Akhund calmed down and his parents asked for an explanation: از وجه تعزیرم سوال کردند
- The Akhund claimed that Khamuli had tricked him: آن کودک شما مرا فریب داده 
- Khamuli was reading verses better than the Akhund and hence must have been tricking him somehow: مدّت است که میخواند هر چه من از یاد میخوانم بجای آنرا از من بهتر میداند
    - The Akhund could not understand how Khamuli could fail to understand something he wrote down (i.e. be illiterate) and yet flawlessly recite it. (Duh - because he was divinely inspired.)
- An uncle (طغا?) declared that it was divine will (وهبی است از عنایت ازلی) and that the child must be trained; the akhund complied (ناچار آخوند کار را از سر گرفت و دست آزار را کوتاه کرد)
11b

- Wine intoxication metaphors for how quickly he gained literacy at the hands of the persuaded akhund: بساغر ذهن این مخمور هشیاری ریخت و تریاک لطف را بر هر قهر در آمیخت
- So quickly did he progress that it was not long before he had outgrown the maktab and it became his prison: و مدّتی چند دلم چون قلم خسته و پایم مانند خط بسته محبوس خانه مکتب بودم
- Goes through some florid prose about how important learning was to him.  For instance, he was ignorant and unannointed until: تا شمع سوادم روشن و صخن ساختم نور افکن گردیده چون قلم روشناس کاغذ و آشنای خد گردیدم
- His perspective changed for ever one day in the fall (میزان) when a Dervish (ریاضتی) passed by him on his way to school. (*check this*)
- Khamuli says that it is a custom of the Turks (رسم اتراک) to send children to maktab in میزان because there is not much work for them to do (چرا که موسم بیکاری اطفال است); their stint in school (سواد خانه) ends in حمل as a rule of the tribe (قاعدۀ ایلاست) because this is when the sheep give birth (هنگام بره های اولاد است).  In all, they have 6 months for study.
12

- Khamuli advanced sufficiently rapidly that he quickly effectively became the akhund's assistant: در اثنای مدّت مذکوره اکثری خلیفه آخوند بودم
    - And very soon thereafter Khamuli himself ended up taking the role of the akhund: در اخیران اوقات آخوند اطفال گردیدم
- At age 14 he finished maktab.
- In the sense of outward, formal learning he had made great progress, but his spiritual, internal growth left much to be desired: هر چند امتیاز سفید از سیاه بحسب ظاهر گشت امّا بحسب تشنگی باطن در ترقی بود
- At the end of the page he concludes that if outward learning (zahir) is all there is to knowledge (ilm), then he is the best of them.
12b

- Khamuli is driven to understand the Arabic in Farsi books (*I can relate*): هرگاه در کتاب فارسی بکلمۀ عربی دوچار میرسیدم آرزوی فهمیدن معنی آن در دلم خارها میگذاشت
    - *this is important; it means that in the maktab children were taught to recite and literacy, but not to understand the Arabic they were reading.*
- Khamuli has some choice words about the state of learning in his tribe; once he got to a certain level, he was surprised to realize anyone who had achieved even basic literacy was called an akhund, mulla, or alim: در میان قومی بودم که علم را منحصر در خط شناسی و عالم را مخصوص در سواد خانی میداشتند کسی را که خطی میخواند حضرت آخوند خط خطایش میکردند و شخصی را که سواد داشت داملا حسابی مینمودند
    - As paltry as their skills were, there was no one better where he was from.
- Khamuli realizes / is divinely inspired (تا آنزمان که بفضل حق تعالی ملهم گردیدم) that his tribe was common and ignorant (عوام) and that there must be better scholars in the world: البته در عالم سوای این جماعه خواص موجودند
    - So he splits with them and leaves in search of something better: از دولت آن قوم خواهم یافت و این معمّای بسرشته (؟) را از تحصیل ایشان وا شکافت
13

- All of Khamuli's being was pinned on this superior milieu of scholars: در طلب آن جماعه ابرار چون چرخ دوّار مانند انجم بسیار بودم
- Khamuli was trapped; his parents wanted him to be a shepherd (شبانی) but he was thirsty for more ilm.
- He exhibits remorse at disobeying his parents wishes that he become a shepherd: افسوس هزار افسوس از ترک آن خدمت
13b

- It was God who swayed his parents to his side: مگر که حق تعالی روح ایشانرا بفضل خود از من راضی گرداند
- The author did not initially even know what a madrassa was: میگفتم که شنیده ام که مدرسه نام جایست که تحصیل علم از آنجا میباشد
- Recites a brief poem in Turki about how his eyes were fixated on going to madrasa.
- This situation persisted until 1202 when the author was in Shahrisabz. (*from here gets into some garbled metaphors about beling lost in the desert of ignorance*)
14

- Ultimately, his mother takes his side and agrees to intercede on his behalf to his father: ایفرزند این یکبار هم سخن من امل نمای تا به پدرت عرض نمایم که ترا بمدرسه برده
- It was a tear-filled decision; Khamuli could not sleep that night.
- His parents accept that he is no use for non-academic work: میگفت که این فرزند شما بکار های روزگار سر فرود نمیآرد و غیر از مطلب علم مطلقاً بامری سر نمیآرد
- And so his father finally acquiesed, but emphasized that it would be a difficult life because Khamuli had not yet even reached 15 years of age and they have no relatives in the city (as of yet unclear *which* city) to watch over him: از سنّ او پانزده سال تمام نشده و در ولایت ما را خویش و سوزی نیست که تعهد او نماید
- Also, notes the father, the city is full of scoundrels: و مردم شهری اکثر اوباش است
- Based on the last sentence of this page, it is also possible that the father is worried they are going to make a bacha bazi out of him (*check*).
14b

- *based on first sentence of this page and the last one of the previous I am pretty sure his dad is worried about him becoming a bache bazi*
- Father says that, in any case, they must send him to a __chaste__ (پاکدامن) alim: بهر حالش بمدرسه باید برد بیک عالم پاکدامن باید سپرد
    - After all: در عالم اگر چه بدان بسیارند امّا ایکان نیز موجودند
- Father rationalizes that if things get too bad the youth can always return home.
- There was much weeping at his impending departure: امّا آن دو مرحوم تا روز میگریستند و شبنم سرشک بگلزار رخساران متقاطر و متوالی بود
15. Off to the Madrasa (finally) in Kitab

- This Zahir - Batin distinction is ubiquitous for Khamuli, even when he is not using it in a Sufi sense.  For instance, when he is discussing how his parents are reacting to his imminent departure: هر زمان آن دو مرحوم بروی من نگاه میکردند بظاهر بتبسم داشتند امّا در باطن گریا داشتند
- It happened to be the bazaar day that his father told him that he was going to madrassa.  *Not sure if this is significant or not... perhaps connected with travel arrangments?*
- Father sends him to Kitab, which is on the outskirds of Kish (i.e. Shahrisabz).  The madrassa was named (roughly) خالبای اشکباشی کَنکبَر
- Author was under the tutelage of Irnazar Namangani ایرزظر نمنگانی
15b.  Minibiography of Khamuli's Mu'allim

- Despite the name, Khamuli's teacher was not originally from Namangan.
- Namangani was born in Farghana (valley or town?), then went to Bukhara to study, then went to Namangan, which is why he has the name.
- In Namangan he became engaged in teaching the hard Islamic sciences (علم ظاهر) to students: در آن ولایت باقاده طلبۀ علم ظاهر خود را مشغول داشته
    - Just as he was simultaneously bedecked in inner (باطن) piety, asceticism, etc: و باطن را به تزهید و تدین و تقوی آراسته 
- All the local residents were his murids: و متولدان آن ولایت همه شاگرد و اعیان تمام مرید و مخلص بوده
- @@important@@ No one in the town mixed with the government; they were devoted exclusively to piety:  بحکام ولایت اختلاط نداشته همیشه ذوق طواف بیت الله و شوق زیارت مرقد منوّر رسول الله... شرفاً در کانون سینه اش اشتغال داشته
- The muallim was never tied down by children or marriage.  
16

- The Hakim of Namangan called the Mudarris to be a qazi, but the Mudarris refused: بمقتضای قدر حاکم نمنگان حضرت آخند را بتقلید قضأ بلاد تکلیف نموده و ایشان باعترازش آمده که من وقوف بمسایل قضا ندارم
- The Qaziship here is described as a burden and the Mudarris's resisting it as a triumph: حاکم خاوسته که بگره و تعدی قلادۀ قضا با عدم رضا ب کردن آن آزاده مرد بر بسته بنده نفس اماره اش گرداند
    - *on the one hand this fits very well with the Crone thesis; on the other hand, we know that Khamuli himself becomes a qazi of Samarkand, so... (then again even this is not so different from the situation of Abu Hanifa and Abu Yusuf)*
- For this reason the Mudarris abandoned his homeland of Ferghana and migrated to Kish / Shahrisabz.
- The people of his new province of residence were immediately captivated by him: و مردم آنولایت شیفته جمال طاعت و عاشق کمال عبادت آن بزرگ گردیده
16b

- Describes a scene where the Mudarris (described as a پادشاه معنوی) triumphantly enters the city on horseback and all come out to greet him.
- According to the author's hyperbole, the Mudarris is veritably freeing the people of Kish from living in ignorance like a bunch of animals.
- Tribe ruling Shahrisabz (@@important@@); the Mudarris quickly made powerful friends in this emirate : امراء کنگس که در انوقت شهرسبز در (خطه( تصرف آنها بود همه مرید و مخلص و کبرای آندیار بنده و از غلام خاص بودند علد المخصوص امیری بود از آنجماعه که مدار ملک آن مملکت باو وابسته 
17

- The ruler of Shahrisabz builds a madrasa for this Mudarris: و آن امارت پناه در مرکز برده مدرسه از برای طلبۀ علم بنا فرموده در یکی تلی که در آن ولایت معروف است و حجرت کثیره در اطراف آن بنا نموده هر کدام از آن حجرت برای سکنای دو نفر از هنرمندان علم 
17b

- The Mudarris's followers at the madrassa were well provided for: چنانچه میبایست  مهیّا داشت
- On this page Khamuli finishes the Mudarris's tale and returns to the part where his parents drop him off and entrust him over to the teacher: و جنابشان  از کمال فتوت بتوقیع فرزندی ام قبول نموده سرفراز بخشیدند
- Instant initiation (hazing): The tradition was to dive right into the lessons; luckily, Khamuli passed with spades: ابتدای درس را جنانجه رسم است تلقین فرمودند بمجرّد یکبار گفتن آنرا حفظ نمودم
- His precociousness quickly caught the special attention of the Mudarris (*i.e. Akhund; in the notes so far I have used the word Mudarris as I am trying to figure out what exactly to call the guy, but Khamuli uses the word Akhund*)
- The Mudarris tells Khamuli to stay near his room at night and not to mix with the other students: فرموده اند که شبها در جوار ما بوده بی اجازت ما بکلبۀ علم اختلاط ننما (continued on to p. 18).
18

- Importance of rote memorization: هر روز از صرف هوای تعلیم فرمودند القای درس با حفظ آن جز در ذهن ممتاز نبود
- Khamuli's incredible memory allowed him to quickly surpass expectations and he demanded more and more lessons, which the mudarris obliged.
- Khamuli surpassed any study partners he was given within a week: هر طفلی که اختیار شریکی ام میگرد بیک هفته همیکشد (؟) طالبان علوم از محافظه ام معجبها دشتند
- Khamuli's genius quickly became the talk of the town.
18b

- An angel warns Khamuli against the other students in the school with the face of men but hearts of demons: آن فرشته رحمت نصیحتم مینمود که ایفرزند ازین آدم صورتان در معنی غولانه شادراه دینند بلکه سالکان طریق شیاطین لعین زینهار در حذر باش
- These peculiar, sinister denizens of the madrasa were wolves in sheeps clothing: گرگانی میدیدم در پوست گوسفند در آمده دی
- The only thing that saved Khamuli from corruption was his prior arrangement with the Mudarris: بی شایبه تکلف میگویم که اگر سبقت مصاحبت حضرت آخوند نبودی نی نی بلکه سابقه فضل الهی راه سعادتم ننمودی چون برّه از آن گرگان میرمیدم
19. The strange tale of the infidel Shah's daughter

- Author is seriously playing up the dire fate that awaited him had he not met his Mudarris before the evil students: بفرضی اگر مشاهدۀ طلبۀ بی پرهیزی قبل از ملاقات استاد متقی ام واقع شدی از علم و علما تبرأ می جستم و تا قیامت بداغ متسّم و بنقض نادانی متهّم میبودم
- Premise of the tale of the king's daughter: پادشاه عظیم ایشان بود و دختری داشت در غایت حسن و جمال و نهایت غنج و دلال ببلاغت رسیده
- Basically she was really beautiful and a flirt, so people from all over the land fell in love and asked for her hand in marriage.
19b

- This kafir princess became enamored with Islam.  One day she could not conceal her secret any longer and revealed it to a co-religionist (همکیشان).
- She asks one of her co-religionists to send her to talk with one of the great men of Islam.
- One of the handmaidens (کنیزان) informed the king of this.  He became livid with rage, as colorfully relayed by Khamuli: از شنیدن نام مسلمان چون زنار بخود پیچید و چون بت از عقل بیگانه گردید و چون ناقوس نالید.
- The shah turns to his Brahman (برهمن) for counsel, realizing that he needs to take firm action before the matter is out of his hands: قبل از اینکه کار از دست رفت و دست از کار رود پای همت در میدان سعی باید افشرد و کوی ضلالت از معرکۀ شقاوت برون باید برد
- The infidel padishah makes a deal: if the brahman can get his daughter to turn from the Muslim path, he will give him a thousand dinar.  If, however, the daughter remains Muslim, he will destroy his idols to, @@interestingly@@, the gods of the Satanic verses: عزی و لات و منات.  Full quote: اگر.. دختر مرا از راه مسلمانی برنگردانی سوگند بعزی که لات را بر سر منات را در چای لات خواهم شکست
20

- The brahmin hatches a plan: show the daughter the worse Islam has to offer (قبیح از قبایح) and she will return to the fold.
- The brahmin found a community of Muslims in the دار الکفر who had a muezzen with a repulsive voice and ugly face: موذن مذکور بنا بر ناهمواری حلقوم متسم بآواز بود که نهیق حمار
20b

- So they order the princess onto the back of a howdah; the princess was tormented by her desire to learn the inner secrets of Islam.
- The princess then hears his horrible voice: موذن بد آواز بسر مناره بر آمده چون لک لک پر و بال افتانده بآواز شروع باذان نمود
- Upon hearing the horrible voice, the princess turns white like death and faints.
- The awfulness of the sound damages her very soul: از ناسازی این آواز وجود عنصری من از وهم ریزد و نزدیک بود که از بدآوازی این ساز مرخ روح از قالب تنم گریزد
21

- The daughter is so stunned that she does not even know what the sound is.  The Brahman leaps out from hiding and gleefully informs her that the sound is the call to prayer which is a pillar of the Islamic relgion.
- Colorful language describing the princess' reaction: دختر این را از برهمن شنید پون مار پیجید
21b

- Just to be an asshole, the brahman sends his reward to the bad-voiced muezzen.  Then to add insult to injury the brahman says that in the future he will send every wavering kafir to the muezzen to cure them: بعد هر کس از اسل کفر اراده اسلام نماید بنزدیک تو فرستم
- It seems that the entire story of the princess and the brahman was to illustrate the areligiosity of the other students in the school.
- In any case, he had already exhausted everything there was to learn after 6 months in the madrassa: بمحض فضل بیچون تخمیناً شش ماه از ابتدای درسم گذشت در باطنم فی الجمله رشدی محبوس گشت

22. Return to the Adventures of Khamuli's Akhund

- Khamuli's brilliance was also a cause for jealousy among his rivals.
- In any case, after some time the Akhund decided to go on hajj: جناب حضرت آخند اشتیاق زیارت بیت الحرام و تعشق طواف مرقد منوّر رسول صلی الله علیه و سلم از کانون دل مشتعل گردیده
- So the Akhund took his leave of Kitab and made for India (هندستان) where he would take the sea route.
    - Interesting remark about India, which at that time seems to have had a reputation for Sufism: از جانب هندستان که خاک تیره اش توتیای چشم اهل عرفان است
- Khamuli describes his anguish at the departure of his mentor.
- Describes his mentor as ملا جلال عصر - the glory of his age.
- On the way to India the Akhund passes through Kabul - but never ends up making it any further because there was a glorious Pir whom he met there. (We know he was glorious because Khamuli spends nearly a full page describing his grandeur.)

22b

- This is the first time the author mentions the Naqshbandiyya by name, implying that the Akhund was not a part of the order previously - at least the Mujaddiya: ... اولیاء عظام ثمرۀ الفواد اصفیای کرام مجدد طریقه نقشبندیه  نقشبند مسلک مجدیه (= مجددیه)؟
- The Afghan Pir's name: حضرت فیضی خان
- In Kabul Khamuli's mentor embraces Hazrat Fayzi's leadership and joins the order: دست ارادت بدست آن رهبر اولیا داده سر عبودیت بپای عرش پایش نهاده
- The Akhund spent approximately two years (and 11 months?) studying the Naqshbandi ways in Kabul engaging in ریاضت و مجاهدت ورزیده از هدایت به نهایت

- The Akhund was appointed to go out and improve the inadequate (beginning on previous page): از برکات ارشاد آن یگانۀ افراد افراز گشته به ترتیب ناقصان و تقویت عاجزان مأمور و مرخص گردیده
- @@important@@: Moreover, the Pir of the order forbids him from going on the hajj in favor of recruiting new members in his homeland: و حضرت ایشان باشارت غیبی حضرت آخوند را از سفر حجاز منع نمودند فرمودند بمضمون العود المد شما را لایق بلکه واجب آن است که بملک فرغانه که وطن مألوف شما است باید رفت و طالبان آن ولایت بهر خاصیت را بمطلوب باید رسانید که حدیث صحصح است پیغمبر صلی الله علیه و سلم فرموده اند که خیر الناس من ینفع الناس
    - *notice how the Pir employs the hadith to justify his decision*
- The Akhund nodded in assent and left Kabul for Mavrannahr.  From Shahrisabz and Qarshi he went to Samarkand.
- As it happened, at that time the author's father was with his tribe (قبیله) at the base of a mountain to the south of Samarkand.  The Akhund and his followers were going through a pass (عقبه) at that time and ran into Khamuli's father on the slope of the pass.
- Naturally, the father took the Akhund in as his guest.

23b

- The Akhund got reacquainted with Khamuli's father and they stayed up all night catching up: آنشب چون شب قدر بسلام بمطلع فجر رسانده اند
- The Akhund __recruits__ new Naqshbandi disciples in this village: والدین ام باخوان و اقراب صغار و کبار و رجال و نساء مریدان مرشد کامل گردیده کلمۀ طیبه را چنانچه طریقۀ نقشبندیه است بآنجماعت تلقین نموده چند روزی در آنجا اقامت ورزیده
    - *so it seems only a few days are necessary to recruit new disciples into the order; also... can women join in any capacity?*
- After this the Akhund goes to visit shrines in Bukhara: حضرت آخوند بزیارت اولاء الله ارادۀ بخارای شریف نموده
- After that the Akhund returned to Samarkand on his way to Farghana.
- Meanwhile Khamuli was in Shahrisabz; when he heard that the Akhund visited his father's house he traveled home, but just missed the Akhund.  Luckily, Khamuli caught him on the way back.
- *Note that the language Khamuli uses to describe the Akhund is nearly romantic and appears to be following Persian literary conventions of the Beloved*

24

- The Akhund finally returns to Samarkand on his way to Farghana and Khamuli of course falls before his feet and showers him with honor.
- It seems that the Akhund then made Khamuli one of his murids: جنابشان خرحمت قدر استاذی را بشفقت جدیدم شدی در حقم نصارت و سر سبزی بخشیده
- Then the Akhund finally left Khamuli for Namangan.

24b

- Once in Namangan the Akhund immediately gained a devoted following: قدوم مبارک آن عزیز را باحترام مالاکلام تلقی نموده اهلای آن ولایت بارادت کالم و اخلاص شامل @@یا مرید یا شاگرد یا مخلص@@ آن عزیز بودند
- The Akhund died in approximantely 1212 hijri (1797/1798 AD).

25. Wherein Khamuli takes on a New Teacher

- After the Akhund left for Namangan, Khamuli obtained permission to study under a new teacher, who had been a student of the Akhund in his youth: فقیر از مفارقت استاد مهربان از خذمت والدین اجازت گرفته بخذمت استاد ثایل معلّم اوّل طفل ابجدخان دبستان تعلیم آن قُدسا نفس بود
- And so Khamuli set off for Shahrisabz to study with the new teacher.
- Khamuli recites a poem comparing his new mentor to Plato (افلاطون).
- Interesting that his new teacher is described as a مجتهد العصر و الآوان, among many other things, *though I am not totally sure what to make of this title.*
- The __name__ of Khamuli's new teacher: جناب محمد لطف الله خواجه
- From this point Khamuli traces his lineage.  His father is: محمد مومین خواجه

25b

- *starting at the end of the previous page is a confusing section of honorifics that mentions some names without saying exactly why*
- Tursun Khwaja Chalabiyya (جناب ایشان ترسونخواجه چلبیه): father or Muhammad Muminin Khoja and hence grandfarther of Lutf Allah.
- This family traces their ancestors both to Ali and Abu Hanifa.
- Author notes that Tursunkhwaja deserves his a separate book, so great is he; in lieu of that, the author relates two miraculous episodes (خوارق) from his life: درین خختصر بجای دو شاهد بذکر دو خوارق عادت از خوارق آن بزرگ اختصار کرده
- The __first miracle__ (خوارق) is relayed from Tursunkhwaja's father محمّمد مؤمنين خواجه
- The story takes place in the court of the Hakim موسی بی ولد الله یار بی مینگ of Urgut (اورگوت).  Note that this guy is a @@Ming@@ dynast.
    - Note that Musa's rulership of Urgut was dynastic; the author notes that it was inherited hereditarily (quote continues on to the next page): حکومت آنولایت از دیر مدّت تعلق باسلاف آن میر سعادت مصیر داشته

26. Tursun Khwaja's first miracle: Intervention during an execution

- Because of "various affairs of the Uzbeks" (بعض امور اوزبک) the slave / servant (غلام) named Baqi (باقی) fell into disfavor in front of Hakim Musa; Musa ordered his execution.
- When Baqi's children and wife heard the news they came to the court to plead for his life.  Tursun Khaja agreed to intervene.
- Tursun goes to the court and demands that the amir intervene and pardon the offender, noting that on the day of ressurection those who forgave will be in turn forgiven, quoting a hadtih of course.

26b

- The Hakim is outraged and says soomething along the lines of "who the hell do you think you are waltzing in here from another province and telling me what to do?"  Also notes that he consulted with all of the great men of the court on this issue and so is in the right.
- Then Tursun says something that really pisses the Hakim off: "If God does not wish you to kill this man, then you will not be able to."  ای میر اگر در ازل ایزد تبارک و تعالی قتل این غلام را از دست شما تقدیر کرده باشد نا چار واقع خواهد شدن و الّا از دست شما که مخلوق ضعیف و ناتوانید کشتن پیشه نمیآید که توانید که یکتار موی از سر این غلام کم نمآید
- Those in attendance realized that Tursun's words had ensured the execution lest the Hakim lose face in front of his court.

27

- With grim resolution, the Hakim grabbed a knife and plunged into the slave's heart: بقوّت تمام در سینۀ برهنۀ آن مسکین غلام چنان محکم 
- But the sound that emerged was like two stones striking one another.  
- Those in attendance were amazed to open their eyes and see that the prisoner was totally unharmed: هیچ اثری در اعظای او از رنچ کارد پیدا نبود
- Even more incredibly, the knife handle was broken in two (quote spills on to next page):  کارد را دیدند که در صحن میدان دسته اش دو قطعه شده و تیغش مانند شصت خم آورده در زمین آفتاده

27b

- The Hakim's hands were all black and blue (کبودی) from the force of the strike.
- Upon seeing this miracle, some members of the court fainted immediately, others began shouting in amazement. Some began falling at Turson's feet, rependting and begging him to guide them.
- Hakim Musa, too, miracurously returned to the fold: امیر موسی مذکور بود از اعجاز آن ید بیضا د رصورت عصا از اژدهای نففس امّاره خلاصی یافت
- Implies that those in attentance became his murids: همه از ارادت پاک و اعتقاد تمام بمصافحه با برکت آن خضر راه طریقت مستعسعد گردیده
    - And even more explicitly: اکثر امرای منگسیه و کلانان تاجکیه اورگوت که بسعادت ازلی مسعود بودند بشرف @@مریدی@@ و سعادت توبه فایزی (؟) گردیدن
    - Author names some of the individual Amirs who became his murids.

28

- Not clear how seriously he means the term, but Khamuli uses the term کفر when describing the state from which they entered the muridship of Turson.
- From this point and for half of the next page Khamuli records a poem - one of the longer ones of this work.

28b.  Tursun Khwaja's second miracle: The incredible growing beams

- Turson Khaja sends his murids too all the cities of Central Asia (?).
- There was a mountain to the south of Urgut (اورگوت) near Shahrisabz.  The pass there must have been a waystation because Turson decided to build a congregational mosque (جماعۀ نماز) for travellers.

29

- Just as they were consecrating the mosque with the Fatiha they realized that the beams were too short, which made everyone sad and ashamed.
- Turson proclaimed that they would put the beams in place anyway.
- Miraculously, the beams grew about 9 inches (ندی) and fit the walls: بفرمان خداوندی آن چوب از هم دیوار قرب یکوجب زیاده آمده
- Naturally, everyone fell upon their knees and cried out admiration of the Khwaja.
- There are many other examples of this sort of miracle: امثال این کرامت جلیه و خوارق علیه از آن بزرگ بسیار نقل نموده
- Khamuli conducted his own investigation of the matter and found witnesses; he condemns the doubters of these miracles.

29b. On the nature of miracles and the possibility of female prophets

- *It's hard to know what to make of this section; for several pages Khamuli first seems to be proving to us that miracles are indeed possible and that friends of God exist; then he gets sidetracked (?) on a lengthy discussion of the possibility of female prophets - he comes down strongly on the negative side.  The language is also particularly challenging here.*
- References the miraculous transfer of بلقیس's throne to the court of Sulayman.  Then talks about a miracle involving Maryam and the miraculous production of water from parched ground.
- Khamuli's directly stated take on miracles: تا قیامت برای نصرت اولیا اش در نظر اعدا خواره و کرامت باهرات از دست مقرّبان در گاهش ظاهر و صادر گردند
- *At the very least, it seems clear from these pages that there is a debate over the existence of miracles, or at least* who *is capable of them*.

30

- This is the page where Khamuli really gets started on the tangent (?) of denying female prophethood: از جنس زن خدای تعالی اصلا پیغمبر نفرستاده است
- To make his point the author referenecs a famous commentary on the hadith of Bukhari: فتح الباری. Apparently this book rules negatively on the mother of Moses, who performed miracles (?), but was not a prophet.
- As it turns out, however, there is not universal agreement on this matter among the ulama, though they only mean that they mean it in the sense of a messenger: در ظاهر کلام بعض علما که اطلاق نبی بر بعضی نسا مستفاد میشود انجا نبی را بمعنای خبیر است
- Another fiqh commentary referenced: عقاید نفسی (?)
- *Thought: it may also be possible that he is using the women prophethood issue more positively to show that there are non-prophets capable of miracles; i.e. his opponents are saying that there cannot be miracles because that is the domain only of prophets.*

30b

- References a Sharh by مولانا فیضی, who is the Afghan pir mentioned earlier in this book (see p. 22b), which discusses the sanctity of Maryam.
- Khamuli seems to concede that the issue of female prophethood is not immediatley clear from the sources: و از کتب تواریخ و سیر مثل تاریخ تبری و منتخب و روضه الصا اصلا پیغمبری نشانه صراحت و نه اشارة مفهوم نمیشود و انجنین از کتب احادث و صحاح بسیاریرا بقدر وسع مطالعه نموده شد از عنقا جری هست
    - Note the reference to عنقا; see also [[Tārīkh-i Humāyūn-i Gulshanī, 1328]] for such a reference.

31

- Woman can't possibly be prophets because they can't go out and mix with the public at large, activity essential for a prophet.
- Also lists other reasons, like women are not smart enough to be prophets (?).
- At this point Khamuli references his late Akhund as well, who, while not on par with Fayzi in Kabul, is also worty of emulation and he says women are not prophets.
- At this point the author directly addresses why he is going on about this with such verbosity (اینمقصر اینقدر اطناب برای آن نموده) because there was a group of ulama propounding the opposing view.

31b

- Note that the venue in which Khamuli witnessed this group express their views was the informal discussion group (مجالس و معارکه).
- At this point the author starts a new حکایت about just such a debate he had with a prominent Qazi.
- A majlis was held by the Samarkand Qazi قاضی ملا رحمه الله مغیون though he is called popularly ماغیانی.
- In this majlis, Khamuli himself challenges the esteemed Qazi of Samarkand: بنده گفتم چرا بخلاف اجماع علما حکم بنبوت نسا مینمایید
- Qazi Maghiun, naturally, is stunned at this challenge from an opponent of lesser status.  Khamuli proceeds to recite two passages of the Qur'an to make his point.
- Maghium replies that he is basing his position on history after the Quran (کلام الله).  Khamuli is outraged at this response: بنده گفتم که در حق کلام او تعالی چرا بی ادبانه سخن میگوی.  The qazi retorts something along the lines of that it is in fact Khamuli who is out of line.
- Most people in attendance took Maghiun's side: اهل آن مجلس بیشتری طرف او داشتند
- Khamuli expresses his feelings on the matter through poetry: آنجا که حق نهان شد باطل رواج یافت

32. Back to the autobiography

- Khamuli did not waste any opportunity for learning with his new teacher.  At this point he turns to similar self-praise as expressed previously in the work about how gifted he was and how quickly he passed through the different subjects.
- For instance, he studied subjects that others did not study until a much more advanced stage, such as poetic meter (علم عروض و قافیه و شعر) and poetry, geography / topography (علم مصاحت), inheritance law (فرایض).
    - *Notice that poetry and meter is placed right along side the Islamic sciences.*
- Importance of memorization - he could not progress from one lesson to the next until he memorized the last one: از من عهد گرفته بودند که تا حفظ ننمایم بدرس دیگر شروع نمی نمودم
    - In this fashion he could pass on his knowledge to others: سبقی را که امروز میگرفتم فردوی آن بکسی دیگر تعلیم مینمودم
- In this manner Khamuli studied for 3-4 years until there was nothing left for the ustod to teach him.

32b. Journey to Samarkand

- Khamuli's ustod, Lutfallah, entrusts him with a letter to take to the mother of his bride in Samarkand who is also the bother of the Qazi of Samarkand (but not Maghiun): فرموده اند که ترا بسمرقند میفرستانیم باید که این خط را بوالدۀ عروس ما که مادر قاضی القضات جناب میر عبد الحی خواجه شیخ الاسلام بودند رسانده and bring back the response.
- However, there was a problem: the road was hazardous due to war between Shah Murod (پادشاه بخارا امیر معدلت مصیر سعادت تخمیر (؟) امیر سعادت معصوم که مشهور شاه مراد است) and... (continued on next page)

33

- ... and the Hakim of Shahrisabz (باشکر حاکم شهرسبز نیاز (؟) علی دیوان بیگی ).
- Because of the war, the usual war was unpassable.  But Khamuli takes a lesser-known road and gets there and back.
- It seems that the Ustod was requesting from Shah Mausum the right to head the Yalnaktush Bey Madrassa in Samarkand (مدرسه طلّا کاری یلنکتوش بی) and the right to write fatwas for Samarkand.
- The request was granted.  With great fanfare, Khamuli was sent from Bukhara to Samarkand to make this announcement: منصوب گردانیده بمراحم بسیار و عواطف بیشمار باسب جوب (؟) و خلعت مرغوب مرا از بخارای شریف بسمرقند فرستاده  از اقران سر افراز و از امثال ممتاز گردانیده خذمت شان بحسب فرمان پادشاه زمان بسمرقند آمده

33b

- Installed in Samarkand, Lutfallah achieves great success imparting learning to students, to whom he was beloved.
- Khamuli as well studied under his relocated mentor in Samarkand with utter singlemindedness.
- Lutfallah was much loved by the luminaries of Samarkand, but many also were jealous and resented him.
- The aforementioned Qazi Kalon Abdal Hay (میر عبد الحی خواجه قاضی کلان و شیخ الاسلام بلدۀ سمرقند و تومنات) - who was also Lutfallah's brother in law (نسبت برادر عروس بجناب استاد) - became sick with jealousy at the adoration Lutfallah received: از انگشت نمای آن عزیز ناخن حسرت بسینه زده از هجوم رشک و وفور غیرت پای همت براه بیگانگی نهاده
- As a result, Lutfallah was essentially driven from Samarkand: در پی آن شدند که آن بزرگ در سمرقند استقامت ننماید

34

- The elite of the city did not bother to seek out the truth, but instead persecuted Lutfallah; Khamuli cites some hadith to justify the retreat of the wrongfully persecuted.
- And so Lutfallah ditches Samarkand for Shahrisabz, where he was welcomed with open arms by the Hakim there: بشهرسبز هجرت نموده و حاکم آن دیار نیاز علی دیوان بیگی کنکس که مرد خیر علما دوست بود مقدم آن عزیز را مواهب الهی دانسته اکابر آن دیار را باستقبال آن سعادت مند مأمور کردانیده باعزاز تمام ببلدۀ کتاب که بهترین موضع است 
- And so Lutfallah ends up in Kitab, where he was greeted, clothed, and fed by the Ulama and Sayyids and great ones.

34b

- Lutfallah remained in that tranquil place (which he compares to Iram) where he was revered for 5-6 years.
- Nevertheless, he always pined for Bukhara and Samarkand: همیشه در آزروی مراجعت بخارا و سمرقند بیبودند
- It seems that he was not satisfied with the quality of his students in Shahrisabz (?).
- Once again Lutfallah found himself waiting for a letter from his female intermediary (تاج المستورات) until 1210 / 1795-6 when the same intermediary (the wife of the Shaykh al-Islam in Samarkand) obtained a writ from the Amir of Bukhara to reestablish Lutfallah in the Samarkand madrassa - مدرسۀ طلّا کاری (spelling?).

35.  Hikayat: It's not polite to tell secrets in the presence of others

- In his lifetime the Amir of Bukhara gave him two posts: (1) حلّ اشکال طلبۀ دیو and (2) اسعاف حاجات عامه مسلمین
- Lutfallah was renowned for giving honest advice to the powerful and his patrons without fear.
- He also had mad Majlis skills: و در مناظره با علما و مجادله با فضلا بر امثال اقران در حجت و برهان اکثر غالب بودند
- Here begins a حکایت; one day in the madrasa شیر دار بلنگتوش بی (?) the Hakim of Samarkand visited the house of the قاضی القضات, who was  جناب میر عبد الحی خواجه شیخ الاسلام.  Khamuli has great praise for this Qazi.

35b

- Khamuli was also personally in attendance at this majlis.  *Note that he participates even though he later praises another Sufi for abstaining.*
- During the majlis the Hakim and the Qazi began to exchange whispers:  حاکم و قاضی بهمدیگر مسارت داشتند و بگوش یکدیگر آهسته آهسته سخنی میگفتند چون مسارت ممتد شد
- When the whispering became gratuitous, Lutfullah (جناب استادی) remarked that whispering between two individuals in a majlis was contrary to the rulings of the mujtahids of Islam (مجتهدان اسلام). I.e.: مسارت دو کس را در مجلس مسلمان منع کرده حکم بحرمت این خصلت مذموم که بدعت شوم است
- The Hakim had nothing to say to this.  The Qazi manages a comeback - you should not have been listening in on our conersation.
- Lutfallah rejoinds: Shame on you, a Muslim of such stature, lest others follow your example.
- Lutfallah makes his point by vaguely referencing scholarly consensus and then references a hadith.

36

- Ultimately, the Hakim and the Qazi back down: بعد از آن حاکم و قاضی ترک مسارت نموده
- The great ones of the majlis expressed their approval of Lutfallah's position: اکابر اظهار حق نماید
- After a poem, the author writes that in the year 1215 Amir Mausum (Shah Murad) and Haydar came to the thrown.
- Upon taking the thrown, Haydar summons Lutfallah to Bukhara.

36b.  Lutfallah is summoned to Bukhara by Amir Haydar then moves to Hisar

- In Bukhara Lutfallah is appointed by Haydar to a prominaent madrassa: و مدرسۀ شهر در مدارس عظمه منصوب گردانیده
- After several years in Bukhara, the Hakim of Hisar سید اتأ لیق نور, who was the father of Haydar's (امیر سعید) daughter, whose ancestors had been murids of حضرت ایشان (presumably referring to Lutfallah's teacher and Khamuli's first teacher from Namangan?), and who himself was (again, presumably reffering to:) Lutfallah's student: خود نسبت شاگردی بآن استاد العلما داشت.  
- This Hakim invited Lutfallah to his province.  Lutfallah obtained permission from the Amir to serve as Qazi in Hisar: از تحصیل رخصت از امیر بخارا منشور قضأ ولایتش را تماما بنام آن عزیز حاصل نموده
- Lutfallah spent several years in Hisar where he both served as Qazi and instructed students.
- (check) @@interesting@@: The heathen ways of the Mongols were still alive amongst the Uzbek tribes in the region.
- Lutfallah brought this province back into accordance with the Sharia: و نهال شریعت می نشانیدند
- Thanks to his efforts of bringing these provincial heathens back to God, the province prospered: از برکت اهتمام آن عالم ربانی مردم آن ملک را سعادت دو جهانی (نافهما( آمال و امانی بود

37.  Death of Lutfullah

- And so it went until Lutfallah died of a headcold and blindness (pnemounia?): آن حشم و جراغ عالم از آب سیاه نزله پر شده
- Khamuli assures us that Lutfallah's good works on earth assure him nymphs in heaven and boy beloveds: و باعث احراز مصاحبت حور و غلمان
- For the last 3-4 months of his life he was blind, but his insight (باطن) remained holy:  مدّه سه چار ماه بظاهری اعمی و بباطن بنیا بود
- On a Tuesday in Muharram the year 1228 (1812) in Dihnaw (ده نو) he passed away.
- At this point Khamuli offers us some poetry that he composed in the month of Lutfallah's death.

37b. Lutfallah's children

- Lutfallah had five children, one of whom died in his early childhood.
- (placeholder: return to a sentance here about the importance of fatwas and the amir's sanction)
- One son was Malla Khoja ملّه خواجه.  He is described as ascetic (متزهد).  He is now a Shaykh in the Kubraviyya Ashaaiyya (کبرویه عشقیه).
    - *so the son is in a different order than his father?*
    - Currently Malla Khoja is in Zia ul-Din (ضیاء الدین) where the light of his greatness shines brightly for the people: بروشنای چراغ ارشاد خلق را براه راست راه نمایند
- It is very clear in this page that the barakat extends through the generations; Lutfallah's children are attributed to inherit his greatness.

38

- Three other children: شیرین خواجه، آفاق خواجه، قاضی خواجه
- Shirin Khoja - goes through the various subjects he mastered - از اشعار و عروض و ادوار و هندسه.  His studies included trigonometry and music.  Also, despite limited opportunity, he learned correspondence writing - انشا و املا.
- Compares his bravery (شجاعتش) to that of Rustam (رستم).
- Spends a lot of time layering generic praise onto this son.

38b

- At this point we move on to Ofoq Khoja (آفاق خواجه), marked here as the ustod's second son, which is curious given the presense of Malla Khoja.
- Ofoq Khoja has a designation of unclear significance: الأسما منزله أسما
- Aside from generic praise, Khamuli remarks on Ofoq's enthusiasm for debate (مجادله و مناظره).

39. Ofoq Khoja the Philosopher

- Ofoq Khoja spent most of his time in Bukhara, apparently, because Khamuli relays a story about how he comes back to his home village of Urgut to visit his father (or mother) and brothers.  *note this suggests a strong tie between Lutfallah's family and this village of Urgut.*
    - Specifically, he returns to visit والده و برادران; so والده could either be the Arabic "his father" or والدة.
- At the time Khamuli was in the service of Lutfalla (?): این بندۀ مقصر در انوقت بحکم قدر قضای آنولایت را متقلید بودم  Or possibly more temporal responsibilities.
- Afaq Khoja comes to Khamuli's abode (بوثاق رهی خود) while Khamuli was teaching two other students: بوثاق رهی خود قدم رنجه دادند در محلیکه بمعدیدی از طلبۀ علم بمکالمۀ درسی داشتم
- They interrupted Khamuli's lesson; he had not seen Afaq Khoja for so long that he did not recognize his old friend at first: و وقت دیدن نو مخطط بودند امراوز ریش عریض طویل به صفحه جمیل

39b

- Lutfallah comes to Khamuli to discuss two philosophical issues (مناظره).  [[Link to transcription of the philosophical points|Transcription of Lutfallah's Philosophical Points of Contention (Khamuli 39b-40)]]
- *my Persian is not up to this highly philosophical language; will need to @@seek help@@*
- Note that this philosophical debate seems to be playing out over some kind of correspondence (رسالۀ شمسیه).

41b.  Qazi Khoja Javon; Lutfallah's Bros

- Here Khamuli starts a new section: ذکر قاضی خواجه جوان
- Lauds the qazi's erudition, etc., using wine metaphors: در خصایل و شمایل و رحاق وسط است
    - Also compares his knowledge and studying to an عنقر.
- Author moves on from the Qazi Javon section somewhat abruptly
- Aside from Lutfallah, Mumin Khoja (his father) had three other children as well.  (Who are therefore Lutfallah's brothers.)  They are:
    - صوفی خواجه، قاسم خواجه، محمد رزاق خواجه
- Qasim Khuja died in his youth (در اوّل آوان رشد و بلوغ).
- Sufi Khoja was two years younger than Lutfallah; named "Sufi" because: مسمّی صوفی صاف دل بود و عارف کامل بود

41. Sufi Khoja (Lutfallah's bro)

- More on Sufi Khoja's quality: از علوم ظاهری و باطن حفظ کامل داشت
- Sufi Khoja's occupation (not sure this gets us anywhere): کارش خدمت مسلمانان و نفع بنده گان خدا بود و بارش طاعت و عبادت بی ریا بود
- Humble in how he conducted himself: بی تکلفانه در لباس و طعام و مسکن و مقام عمر میگذرند
- Educated in Bukhara: سالها در بخارا در تحصیل علوم دینی و تسلیک راه یقینی در تجرد و توکل مستقیم بود
- Author notes with approval that he copied an eigth of the Sharh-i Jalali (@@identify@@) in find writing: در یکهفته شرح جلالی را بخط خوب مینوشت
- Sufi Khoja was so pious that he avoided the halls of power: بدر خانه حکام و اغیاء اصلا نفرف
- Sounds like this guy was a zahid given his eating habits: از لقمهای نرم بنان سخت خرسند بود
- Interesting that Khamuli sees Sufi Khoja's avoidance of majlises as a virture: بمعارک و مجالس حضر نمیشد اگر بی اختیار بمجلس مردم متلا [=مبتلا؟] میگردید جایش صف نعال بود
- Khoja Sufi was frequently in an ecstatic state: اکثر اوقات مجذوب بود جذبه اش بلند بود گاها بمدهوش عاید میگرد اوسع مشرب بود در ستر حال خود اهتمام عظیم داشت در وقت غلبات جذبه اش کسی را آرای بردی او نگاه نبود

41b

- Sufi Khoja shunned temporal power: و از کسی که تکلیف در اعزاز او میکرد میرنجید
- His mastery was superior to that of the ulama: و مولویت بحدی بود که [محول / فحول] علما را در پیش او مجال نطق نبود تا کسی [چیزی] نپرسید ازین منقوله ساکت بود بعد از سوال بقدر ضرورت جواب میگفت
- The amir hears of his erudition, invites him to the court and offers to give him a post, (but he refuses):  محترز بود هر چند پادشاه وقت تکلیف نمود که یکبار آمده مارا دعا کنند تا بحال او ... بعملی از تدریس و مانند آن نصیب تمام و وضیفه و او را تعین کنیم که بخاطر جمعی بکاریکه دارد اشتغال نماید
- It seems that the ulama were telling the amir about Sufi Khoja's quality and the amir wanted to see for his own eyes: میخواست که بچشم خود معاینه نماید
- One day it came to pass that جناب استاد (probably Lutfallah, Sufi Khoja's brother) was paying his respects to the amir in Bukhara and was requested to go fetch his brother: تا انکه جناب استادی علیه الرحمه باری از برای دعا کردن پادشاه مذکوره بخارای شریف تشریف آوردند بعد از ملاقات امیر فرمودند که ما طالب دیدن برادر شما صوفی خواجه [خواستیم] امّا از ما میگریزد

42

- Amir of Bukhara suggests that perhaps Sufi Khoja will listen to his brother Lutfallah; bring him and you shall be richly rewarded: چون شما هم برادر و هم حق استادی دارید شاید که نصیحت شما را قبول نماید اگر آن شخص را بدربار آوردید مراحم بسیار و مواظف شما روی حق شما انکس مینمایم
- Lutfallah accepted the amir's order and went in search of Sufi Khoja.  At this time Khamuli too was in in Bukhara.  At that time he was living in the madrasa گلاباد 
    - Basir: در بخارا در مدرسۀ  گل آباد سکونت داشتم
- They arrive at Sufi Khoja's dwelling: بگذر [خیابان / خیاسان] رسیدیم در ان محله مسجدی بوده در اطراف او پنچ شش حجره محقر چوبین آن عزیز در یکی از ان ویرانه چون کنج خان نشین بوده
- Khamuli is overjoyed to be a part of this auspicious encounter.  Note that he uses the term مجلس to describe it.
- Description of Sufi Khoja's appearance: از جبهۀ مباراک در میان جامهای کهنه و دستار و کفش

42b

- Despite the tattered clothes, there was an aura of beauty about Sufi Khoja: امّا چنان بقد و بالای آن مظهر [فنا] مناسب و زیبنده بود که از هزار کیمخا و دیبای دیگر از آن تجمیل نبود
