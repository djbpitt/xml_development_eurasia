## 1892 Foreign Department. Secret F. Pros. September 1893, Nos. 361-364. Disturbances in Russian Turkistan, and closing of the old cemeteries in Tashkend and construction of new ones. G.C. Press Calcutta - 8.

#### Report from P-Burg based on conversation with Russian political resident (p.1)
"No. 361. (Received with letter No. 37, dated the 27th January 1893, from Secretary, Political and Secret Department.) Asia - Confidential - No. 1737. 12th December - [Section 1.]"
"No. 303, dated St Petersburgh, the 7th December 1892 (Confidential).  From - Sir R.B.D. Morier, her Majesty's Ambassador at St. Petersburgh, To - The Earl of Rosebery, K.G., Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs."

Full text: "With reference to the disorders in Russian Turkistan, to which I have referred in previous despatches, I have the honour to state that a friend of mine obtained the following account respecting them from M. Lessar, Russian Resident at Bokhara, now on leave at St. Petersburgh.  He said that they had their origin in the sanitary measures taken by the Russian authorities in view of the cholera, and especially in the prohibition to use the cemeteries situated in or close to towns for burial; indeed, an order was given for their entire closure.  The older priests had refused to obey this order, and the recalcitrants had been replaced younger and more pliable agents. This had been the prelude to a violent outburst of fanaticism, which was only repressed after great losses in killed and wounded.  The crisis had been deemed so serious that arms and ammunition were distributed to the non-military Russian population of Ferghana and Tashkent, a measure which of course, for obvious reasons, was not readily had recourse to by the Government."

#### Contrary report (p. 1-2)
"No. 363. (Received with letter No. 45, dated the 3rd February 1893, from Secretary, Political and Secret Department.)"
"No. 9, dated St. Petersburgh, the 4th January 1893. From - Sir R.B.D. Morrier, Her Majesty's Ambassador at St. Petersburgh, To - The Earl of Roseberry, K.G., Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs." 

Full text: "The *Turkistan Gazette* publishes a paragraph announcing that thirty-three cemeteries, out of a total of fifty-eight, in the city of Tashkent, have been closed by the authorities, for the reason that they are completely full.  One new cemetery is to be constructed outside each of the twelve gates of the city.  The native local authorities show every sign of agreement with this step, and the inhabitants of each quarter have formed committees to select sites and collect rates for the new cemeteries."

(cont. on p. 2): "This semi-official communication is worth comparing with the statement made by M. Lessar, and reported in my despatch No. 303, Confidential, of the 7th ultimo, as to the cause of the late disturbances in Turkestan."
