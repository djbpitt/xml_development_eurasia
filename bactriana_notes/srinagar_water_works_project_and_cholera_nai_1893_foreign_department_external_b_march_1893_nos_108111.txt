- Year: 1892

Introduction

- Focus on water: "... I feel certain nothing will save Srinagar from periodic attacks of cholera until its sewage is collected and removed, that I ask for the water and sewage schemes to be taken together, and only the best for both to be adopted after careful investigation.  The above is written bearing in mind the fact that the city of Jummo has been practically free from cholera this year, while all around the disease has been prevalent.  That this immunity is due to its water-supply I have no doubt" (2).
- "4. There has been no epidemic of cholera whose history I am acquainted with, which brings out more strongly the truth that cholera is begotten of dirt, and is conveyed by dirty people than this Kashmir epidemic of 1892.  The State of Kashmir itself is only hinted at in these papers.  It is too utterly repulsive and loathsome to describe.  This being so, it can be easily understood what an easy road cholera finds to travel back to India..." (2).

Kashmir a new focus of Endemic Cholera

- The theory: "... in a series of letters which appeared in the *Pioneer* in the early part of 1889 under the signature of **Medicus,** I advanced, *inter alia*, the following proposition: - First, that cholera prevailed in countries where there was an entire absence of sanitation, the habits of the people being so barbarous or so primitive that the air they breathe, the food they eat, and the water they drink are always polluted with sewage, and second, that enteric fever occurred in more civilized communities where some attempt had been made to remove and dispose of this sewage, but which was done so imperfectly, that the excreta in under-ground drains or sewers, or buried in bulk in the soil, underwent fermentation with its complement bacterial development. Kashmir was the instance I had in view, as illustrating my first proposition, subsequent investigation not only confirmed those views, but advanced them to more precise limits" (3).
- Origins in India: "The history of the present epidemic, it is believed, will bring out the fact that the disease was imported from India, and which originating at Hurdwar passed over Northern India in the early part of the hot season.  As usual the disease travelled in a north-westerly direction ultimately finding its way to Srinigar in the beginning of May, its rate of progress being in direct proportion to the ordinary means of locomotion, that is tosay, most rapidly in the plains of India where railways lend themselves to its more rapid diffusion" (3-4).
- Conclusions: "The conclusions then I have come to are that, to prevent cholera becoming endemic in Kashmir, there are three essentials: - The first is a pure water-supply to be given to Srinagar; the second is the construction of sewage works, and, bearing in mind the economic conditions of the people, the remodelling of the city, until opportunity offers, should be limited to effect this in the first instance; and the third is the prevention of the pollution of the Jhelum river, which exists to an extent beyond description" (8).
