This is the manuscript version of what will soon be an edited edition; the late Amriyazdon Alimardonov was working on publishing it.  This source does not seem to be listed in any of the catalogs.  Even though it is called a history, this is really more of a geography.  Much of this text is straight-up data (i.e. number of madrasas, population size); where especially interesting, I will copy down said data and elsewhere I will merely index where it can be found.  Generally, I tried to write down the proper nouns to enable easy searching later on.

#### Introduction
1 (*note: Gulshani himself also numbers the pages starting from here, which means 1b = the author's page 2, page 2 = the author's page 3, etc.*)

- Author's father's name: محمد میر سید مفتی مدرس
- Author mentions that he has reviewed (مطالعه مینمودم) a work by شمس الدین سامی who wrote قاموس الاعلام

1b

- Remarks that in the 86 years since "Meiendorf"'s travels ago many formerly independent cities have been brought under Bukharan control: در آن وقت شهرسبز و حصار و ختلان و قره تکلین (؟) درواز همۀ اینها حکومات مستقله بوده است و اینها در ظرف یک قرن ضمیمآ دولت بخارای شریف گشته است
- Also remarks that Bukhara made great advances (ترقی و تزاید) and that there were great changes (تفاوت بسیار) during these years.
- The title of the book is a reference to one of Abd al-Ahad's titles: چون سال بیست و پنجم از جلوس همایون جنابعالی امیر المومنین و امام المسلمین نزدیک شد
    - *the titles they lavish upon these khans are unbelievable... they address him as a caliph*
