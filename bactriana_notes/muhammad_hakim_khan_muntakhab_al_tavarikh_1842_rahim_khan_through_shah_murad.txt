### The Manghits (منقتیه) p. 353

#### Rahim Khan
p. 353.  This page sets up Rahim Khan as a cruel, but cunning ruler who seized power in Transoxiana.

- Starts out stating that there have been seven figures (in the Manghit dynasty) until now and that they have reigned 93 years.  The first was Rahim Khan: رحیم خان بن حکیم اتالیق بن خدایار اتالیق بی خدایقلی بی بن چاوش بای
- Rahim Khan subjugated many and took the title khan by giving away awards and titles (انعام و احسان).
    - Describes Rahim as cruel and a tyrant (جباری، ظلم پیشه، غیور)
- Lists the governors of the different major cities in Transoxiana:
    - In Khoqand ruled ایردانه بی والنعمی
    - In Uratipa (اوراتیپه) ruled فاضل بی والنعمی ابن صادق
    - In Shar-i Sabz ruled: عالم بی بن ابراهیم اتالیق
    - In Hisar (حصار) ruled: شادمان محمد امین بی 
- These are the amirs of Chingis Khan: "امیران کینگس"
- None of the Uzbek (lit.) amirs were equal to Rahim, so he used deception to draw the stupid (ساده لوح) amirs to him like lambs to the slaughter (به پای خود به سلاخ خانه رسیدند).
p. 354.  Interesting page because (a) Rahim Khan is confounded by some guy in a fortress and (b) he finds Shahr-i Sabz to be deserted - perhaps a result of the chaos of the mid 18th century?

- Rahim Khan was unable to subdue one of the amirs, who just remained in a fortress outside of Shari-i Sabz.  He was not able to defeat this individual so he married the daughter of the rebel's brother and so became his son-in-law (داماد) and then they settled terms (قسم نامه).  In a rage (?) Rahim had 32 Chingissid chancellery officials (مهردار کینگس) murdered.
- Rahim Khan then turned his eye on Shahr-i Sabz, the best of realms (عروس ممالک), but found it empty (شهر سبز را از اغیار خالی یافت).
    - He stayed there for a few days and then gave it to a slave (غلام خویش قوتلوق) to govern, the divan bigi, and returned to Bukhara.
p. 355: Recollections of Rahim Khan taking the army to Uratipa (ذکر لشکر کشیدن رحیم خان به صوب اوراتیپه).  Illustrates the balance of power during this period in Transoxiana as well as Rahim Khan being outsmarted by a rival.

- Rahim Khan declares ایردانه بی وانعمی his honorary son (? - فرزند قیامتی) and sends a herald to summon him to war, which he obeys.
- Rapprochement between Bukhara and Khoqand worries فاضل بی والنعمی, the ruler of Uratipa, and so he summons محمد امین بی of Hisar to help him.
- Rahim called for Uratipa and Hisar to surrender, but they holed up in the fortress of Istiravshan (استروشن), which Rahim and Irdaneh surround.
- The siege put the citizens of the city in dire straits, so Fazel Bey, who had a reputation of being extremely crafty (مکار) such that he was nicknamed محمد امین شیطان, hatched a plan.  He sent fake letters and seals to both Rahim and Irdaneh from each other causing them to suspect one another and disperse their armies.
p. 356

- That night there was a storm so severe that the author compares it to the one faced by Noah, forcing Rahim Khan to give up his army and Irdaneh to run back to Khoqand.  This resulted in a great victory for Uratipa and Hisar and a mountain of severed heads (کلّه مناره) in the plain outside of Uratipa.
- However, Rahim Khan survived and returned to Bukhara and after a bit returned to Hisar with an army.
p. 357.  Interesting reference to rivalries left over from Nadir Shah.

- Rahim returned, subjugated Muhammad Amin Bey, plundered his treasury, and captured him.
- Exposition: Rahim Khan was considered exceptional under Nadir Shah, but in all respects Muhammad Amin Bey had been considered superior, and Rahim Khan did not get the respect he wished.  Rahim was jealous and wanted revenge.
- Rahim Khan summoned a council of the amirs, ulama, and sayyids.  Muhammad Amin Bey shows up bareheaded and barefoot (سر لوچ و پا برهنه) and greets the ulama without even regarding Rahim Khan.
p. 358.  This is a crucial passage because it illustrates that Rahim Khan was dependent on the ulama to secure his own legitimacy for a Persian title.

- Rahim Khan is not pleased.  He drags Muhammad Amin to the bazar and has him killed, saying that he will never be amongst Muslims again (هیج وقت تو مسلمان نمیشوی).  Amin gets hanged and beheaded.
- After this point Rahim Khan bowed to no one.  He gives Hisar to one of his amirs and returns to Bukhara.
- After some time he defeats Khorosan, but apparently does not incorporate it.
- After Rahim returned from Khorasan several sycophantic ulama (چندی از علمای بیعمل خوش آمد گوی فتوی دادند) wrote a fatwa proclaiming that any ruler who could support twelve thousand men was entitled to the tile of padishah, which Rahim adopted without delay.
p. 359

- To mark his new title they begin reading his name in the khutba and coining currency in his name.
- He had a favorite concubine named Mirza Baghir (میرزا باغر) who sat on the harem throne and was always ready with a sweet word or advice.  (Note: this could actually have been a eunuch - unclear in text).
- One day he became angry with her and ordered her and ordered her death and she was brought before the khan, whereupon she read some verse.
p. 360

- Mirza Baghir tells the khan a witty verse or two and he forgives her, overcome with laughter.
p. 361.  The somewhat ignominious death of Rahim Khan.

- One day Rahim goes on pilgrimage to a great Sufi: قطب الاولیا غوث الاتقیا حضرت خواجه عبد الخالق غجدوانی who is also known simply as خواجه جهان.  While there Rahim did something rude or ill-mannered (farted) and became very embarrassed and averted his head from the Sufi master.  در حال رنگ و روی او سیاه گشته.  After this incident Rahim Khan returned to Bukhara and departed from this world.
- Rahim Khan facts listed here: He was 36 when he died; was an amir for 10 years; a padishah for 2 years; ruled Bukhara for 12 years
- Rahim Khan had no children and one of his managers (آخور) named بیک نظر بی ابن بهدر بی جلو میر wrested Shahr-i Sabz for himself, and the other Chingissid amirs rebelled as well.

#### Danial Bey

- Danial Bey, Rahim's uncle, took the throne.  He was very honest and mild (بسیار حلیم و راست قول) and did not proclaim himself padishah.  Instead he found a descendant of Chinggis named ابو الغازی خان and put him on the throne while holding the real power himself.
p. 362

- Has a good anecdote about how Danial would dress the Chinggisid up like a monarch for ceremonies and then send him back to his camp.
- Danial married Rahim's wife and was very in love with her.
p. 363.  This author has a genuine sense of humor.

- Author relays a story whereby Rahim's wife's wet-nurse (دایه) asks her what she got out of her marriage to each of the three kings.  She replies that she got happiness (حصن) from برس خان, good disposition / manners (خُلق) from Rahim Khan, and great sex (لذت جماع) from Danial Bey.
p. 364.  Death of Danial Bey, rise of Shah Murad

- Danial Bey dies of a fatal illness.  He was 75 years old and he ruled for 17 years.
- He had 5 children, but it was obvious to all that Shah Murad (the eldest) was the one fit to rule.

#### Shah Murad

- Shah Murad was extremely pious, going so far as to imitate the behavior of a dervish, carrying loads around the streets of Bukhara.
- Shah Murad was known for his justice and the very day he took the throne he executed the Qazi Kalan of Bukhara who was known for taking bribes.  Also notes that he was well in touch with the affairs of his kingdom.
- Murad was also known for waging war on the Shia.  He conquered Mashhad.
- The governor of Marv at the time was بیرم علی خان, who was appointed by بابا خان اخته, king of Iran.
p. 365. War with Iran

- Murad conquered Marv in a single battle putting much of the populace to the sword and forcing many of the rest to move to Bukhara. He executed the ruler there (who had been appointed by the ruler of Iran).
- Murad captured the ruler of Marv's son, حاجی خان.  Once in Bukhara he quickly escaped and went to Sharisabz where he was friends with نیاز علی دیوان بیگی and remained there for about a year.
    - Murad demanded that Haji Khan be handed over, offering a four thousand ashrafs.
p. 366.  A local governor defies the khan, taunts him, and gets away with it.  Anecdote also illustrates a notion of Uzbek identity.

- نیاز علی دیوان بیگی, governor of Shahrisabz, responds to Shah Murad: "اگر حصول هفت ساله بخارا را بدهند، صورت نه بندد که ما مهمان خود بدهیم. ما مردمان اوزبکیم" - even if you gave me seven years of Bukhara's income I would never hand over a guest.  We are Uzbeks.
- Author makes a woeful comparison between those times when such friendship was exhibited even between Sunni and Shia, and now when 5000 Muslims can be sold for a bit of money.
    - *It seems here that the author views his own time as one of decadence and corruption.*
- After this Haji Khan went to Khoqand for two years and then on to Kashgar.  (He may or may not have returned to Iran - but he was eventually enthroned somewhere).
p. 367.  Goes on for a while about the beauty of Haji Khan's concubine.  Battles with Timur Shah of Afghanistan.

- In the age of Shah Murad, Timur Shah marched on Mavrannahr.  Shah Murad became aware of this and crossed the Jaihun and at Balkh they parlayed.
p. 368

- Timur Shah was taken aback by Murad's boldness and they reached a truce and returned to their respective thrones.
p. 369.  Shah Murad tries and fails to subdue Shahrisabz

- Shah Murad turned his attention to Shahrisabz and waged a fierce war there, but was unable to achieve victory.  He constructed 18 fortresses on its outskirts, but was nevertheless forced to quit the province.
- Stymied at Shahrisabz, he turned to the country of the Yoziah (یوزیه).
p. 370.  ذکر محاربه نمودن شاه مراد به والنعمی مع خدایار بی والنعمی در موضع قره بلیع

- Khudayar Bey heard this news (that Shah Murad was coming for him?) and took a massive army from Uratipa to Samarkand.  Abdallah Dadkhwah (عبد الله دادخواه) and Yadgar Bey (یادگار بی) came to assist him.
- The armies then met at Qara Baliq (قره بلیق) and engaged in fierce battle.
- Battle lasted 6 days, yet still no one could achieve victory, so everyone returned home.
- The author heard this story personally from قبله گاهم سیادت پناه و نجابت دستگاه ایشان سلطان خان خواجه احراری, who was the nephew of Khudayar himself, as well as from Yadgar Bey.
    - *I.e. the author heard about the battle from eyewitnesses on the Khoqand side.*
p. 371.  The Affair of Baba Parvanchi (قضیه بابا پروانچی)

- According to the author's sources, Khudayar was incredibly brave in the battle; there is a legend that he simply went to sleep in the middle of the battle.
- His (presumably Khudayar's) true brother was Baba Parvanchi, who conquered (فرو گرفت) Hisar.  But after only a few days traitorous fate (فلک غدار) took it from him and he became a prisoner of Bairadi Taz (بیردی تاز).
- After one year Parvanchi broke his chains and made a night escape along with two of his servants.  Morning broke and he could go further and was forced to hide out in a graveyard.
- The guards woke up and saw that he was gone and searched the entire city; Bairadi Taz put a rich bounty out for his capture.
p. 372

- As it happens, the cemetery was right beside a public thoroughfare.  An ugly old man who looked like the angel of death spied Parvanchi and wants to turn him in for the reward.  The young man responds that the old man is crazy and talking nonsense; fortune comes and goes for the great ones like Parvanchi and that they should not screw him over for their own benefit.
p. 373

- The old man cursed the boy for his words, but eventually left.  The young boy knelt in honor before Parvanchi and pledged himself to his service.
- Parvanchi wept and gave the boy his seal, which the boy took to a bearded man at a Caravansarai.
p. 374

- The man at the Caravansarai gave him some provisions saying that he had been waiting a year for the boy to come.
- The boy returned to Parvanchi and the two set off together.
p. 375

- Parvanchi & co. get stuck in a whirlpool famous throughout all of Mawaranahr.
p. 376

- Finally they are rescued by Mir Shir Abad (میر شیر آباد) 
- At first Parvanchi lies, saying "ما سه ملا از کولاب می آییم از برای تحصیل علم به بخارا میرویم".  However, there was a man there who had been in the service of Khodaiar Bey Vallnami (خدایار بی والنعمی) and he recognized Parvanchi immediately.  For this reason, Parvanchi was greeted with tears and embrace and given nice clothes and food.
- Despite being treated so, Parvanchi was pissed about it for some reason.
p. 377.  Shah Murad finds out about Parvanchi

- Shah Murad heard about this and summoned Parvanchi; Parvanchi sat in bondage in Bukhara for a year.
    - Finally, Khodaiar managed to trick (به چندین حیله و تدبیر طلب نموده) Murod into releasing Parvanchi, who was his brother.
- (Not totally positive here) Then Khodaiar gave Parvanchi Jizakh (جیزخ) to govern.
p. 378.  The Delirium (هذیان) of Parvanchi

- Parvanchi, as it turns out, was a bit crazy and prone to exaggeration - which the next couple pages go through in some detail.
p. 380.  Back to Shah Murad: Shah Murad the Poor

- Relays the story about how during a visit to Samarkand Shah Murad runs out of money and is forced to hawk an old sheepskin coat (پوستین) at the market.
    - The mullah who bought the coat rescinded the contract, complaining of lice infesting it, and took the issue before a qadi.  Shah Murad chuckled at the encounter.
p. 381. Shah Murad the Poor continued.

- The qadi attempted to reach a settlement, but the mullah refused even that, saying that he would not pay a cent for such a coat. Unfortunately, Shah Murad had already spent the money.  In any case, they eventually settled.
- Mentions another account of him traveling, this time to Iran, where he had to go hungry and sell his own shoes.
p. 382.  The Attempted Assassination of Shah Murad ذکر کارد زدن برادرانش شاه مراد بی والنعمی

- Two men dressed up as women and sneaked into Shah Murad's harem.  They were vile dogs, but brave: دو مرد کافر کیش بیباک
- These two men seriously messed Shah Murad up and ran away.  However, because God was watching over Shah Murad, he survived.
    - Verse: اگر تیغ عالم بجنبد رجای   |    نبرد رگی تا نخواهد خدای
- The assassins returned to the amirs and reported.  The amirs asked if they were absolutely sure Murad was dead, and naturally they confirmed.
    - The amirs wanted to know where Murad's head was if he was actually dead.  They replied: از هزار جان او یکی خلاص نشده است.  سر را پرسیده، چه کار میکنید
- In fact, Murad was drenched in his own blood, but alive.
p. 383.  Murad shows mercy.

- Once Murad awoke and grieving turned to rejoicing, he ordered to be taken out to the people to show that he was still in control.
- Word spread of his survival and his brothers realized they were in trouble.
- Murad admonished them, but granted them mercy.  The brothers were shamed, but alive.
p. 384.  و نشین بابا پروانچی به جای او به امارت و ذکر لشکر کشیدن شاه مراد بی والنعمی به صوب اوراتیچه

- (Murad recovering from assassination attempt).  Interesting that they characterize his treatment as the wisdom of Plato: حکیمان افلاطون .طبع به مداوای
- Notes (somewhat randomly) that خدایار بی والنعمی died at the age of 56.  I think he is an amir of Khoqand.
- As soon as news of this reaches Bukhara, without delay Murad marches on Uratipa.  They fight to a standstill.
- Mentions that he has guns (تفنگ) at his disposal.
p. 385.  Khoqand gets involved, ذکر عزیمت نمودن شاه مراد بی والنعمی به ولایت خجند

- Khoqand gets involved and there ends up a war between three rulers.
- On the advice of the author's grandfather, they call a truce and return home.  Woot.
- After returning home, Murad gets it in his head that he should conquer Khojand.
p. 386.  Balance of Transoxianan Power

- After three days of besieging Khojand, Murad turns back simply out of the fear that Khoqand *might* intervene.
- As a consolation prize, he engages in wide-scale pillage as he leaves, and - @@interestingly@@ - forcibly resettles part of its population back to Samarkand.
p. 387.  The death of Shah Murad

- After his Khojand expedition, Murad fell sick.
- Murad proclaimed that the sickness was caused by the amir of Khojand and that he would never recover from the illness.
- Goes through how his realm was carved up between his kids.
