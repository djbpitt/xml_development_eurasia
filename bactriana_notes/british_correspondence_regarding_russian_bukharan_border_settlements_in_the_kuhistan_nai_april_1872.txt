A fairly rich file of diplomatic correspondence related to Afghanistan / British - Bukhara / Russia border settlements.  *May be worth revisiting at some point.*

"No. 5. Draft of Memorandum. (Confidential.)  Boundaries of Afghanistan" (7).

- "During the anarchy which followed the death of Nadir Shah, the petty Uzbeg States between the Hindu Kush and the Oxus were incorporated in the Empire of Afghanistan, founded by Ahmed Shah Abdullah about the middle of the last century; and these states continued to acknowledge the Afghan supremacy down to about the end of that century, when for a very brief period a supremacy was exercised over Balkh by the Emir of Bokhara.  Between 1802 and 1826 Bokhara, however, ceased to exercise any influence to the south of the Oxus, whilst the central State of Balkh maintained a semi-independence under the suzerainty of Cabul, and formed part of a province which extended over Renduz and Badakhshan.  After 1826 these States appear to have undergone various vicissitudes until 1849-50, when the Ameer of Afghanistan re-conquered them, and since that date he has been the real and only sovereign of the country."
- (cont.) "The suzerainty of Afghanistan over the territories to the south of the Oxus had been previously recognized by Bokhara in a substantive treaty which was concluded in 1789 and confirmed in 1793; and in 1850, on its being appealed to by Mahomed Akram Khan, the Emir of Bokhara, who was threatening Afghanistan, retired towards his capital, and subsequently, in the negotiations of 1859, he declared that if the Afghans would not interfere with the Turcomans north of the Oxus, he would raise no claim on Badakhshan, Maimana, or other States south of the river.  While, therefore, the treaty may have been violated between 1826 and 1849, it was duly respected by Afghanistan and Bokhara from 1850 to 1869."
- (cont) "With respect to the provinces in question about the year 1854 Shibbargan fully submitted to the Afghan Governor of Balkh without contest, and Shere Hakeem Khan, the Chief of the province, made his submission to Mahomed Afzul Khan, gave up his guns, and paid the expenses of the march of an Afghan army which had been sent against him.  Early in 1855 the people of Maimana and Andkho made their submission in like manner, and presented offerings according to the custom of the country.  Shirpool had made its submission three or four years previously.  Thus in 1855 the Afghan Government was firmly established throughout the whole territory between the Hindu Kush and the Oxus, excepting perhaps in the remote province of Badakhshan; the Chiefs of Maimana, Andkho, and Shibbargan enjoying a semi-independent sway under the suzerainty of the Afghan Governor of Balkh, and Kunduz being governed much in the same way by the Afghan Governor of Khubun.  In 1855 Mahomed Afzul Khan claimed from his father the governments of Khulm, Kunduz, and Badakhshan, that is, the territory exclusive of Balkh and Akcha, and the Afghan dependencies to the westward, of which he was already in possession..."
    - "About the same time [i.e. 1855] an army of the Ameer of Bokhara crossed the Oxus and made an attack on Shibbargan, bu though it obtained at first some success it was eventually completely defeated, and re-crossing the Oxus returned to Kargki" (7).
- (cont) "From 1859 to 1861 Maimana appears to have given some trouble to the Cabul Government, but in 1861 Hakument Khan sent an agent to Balkh, and declaring that Maimana had always formed a part of that province, he promised to pay tribute and abstain from intrigues with Persia, and on the assassination of Hakument Khan, Hossein Khan, his son, acknowledged his dependency on Cabul" (7).
- "His [king of Cabul] right of sovereignty over Badakhshan was also clearly established in 1859, when an arrangement was made with the Ameer of Badakhshan, according to which the ruby and lapis lazuli mines should be made over to the Ameer's officers, and that the Ameer should pay the **nuzzerana** levied by former sovereigns, and send his sons with the levies of his province whenever required to do so.  A tribute was also subsequently settled at two rupees per house; and from that time till the death of Dost Mahomed Khan in 1863 there re no notices in the Foreign Office at Calcutta of any further troubles in Badakhshan" (8).
- *continues the discussion, of possible future interest*

"No. 20. Remarks on a Map and Memorandum relating to Afghan Turkestan, by J. Talboys Wheeler, Assistant Secretary, Government of India, 1869"

- "It will now be attempted to be shown that there is no ground for including any part of the Upper Oxus basin within the limits of Bokhara.  On the contrary Afghan sway was extended by Ahmad Shah Abdallee in the last century not only as far as the left bank of the Oxus affluent, which rises in the Hindoo Koosh, according to the map, but to the Pamir, where the chief source of the Oxus was discovered by Lieutenant Wood of the indian Navy while serving under Captain A. Burnes.  Here the Afghan district of Wakhan, joining Badakhshan, abuts on the Chinese districts of Yarkand of Kashgar and the intercourse between teh Afghan territory and the trading cities in the Chinese Empire by way of the Oxus was never subject to any such interposition on the part of Bokhara as the map indicates."
- (cont.) "More recently Wakhan rendered tribute to Kunduz while under Morad Beg."
- "Further north are Darwaz and the Karabaghin or Black Mountineers with Hissar on the west.  These highland tracts are virtually independent, but rather allied to other parts of the upper Oxus under the Afghans than to Bokhara.  For Bokhara has but a loose hold even on Shuhr-i-Subz; and Hissar was the seat of Murad Bey's ancestors before they settled in Kunduz..."

"No. 23.  Memorandum on a remark in an abstract translation of a letter from the King of Bokhara to the Ameer of Cabul, printed in the Proceedings of the Government of India, in the Foreign Department, Political, April 1870, page 47"

- Translation of Bukharan amir's letter to Kabul amir: "'The territories of Hissar, Kolab, and Kurratakun, which belong to me from my ancestors, have been conquered twice owing to disturbances from rebels.  Lately I have re-annexed the above territories to my kingdom.  I therefore send these joyful tidings."
- (cont) "It does not appear that any notice has been taken of this communication, and it seems desirable to ascertain whether the Ameer has responded to it.  It is remarkable in consequence of its following, so soon after my discussion of Mr. Wheeler's Afghan Turkistan map and memoirs, in which the points affecting British interests in this matter are noticed.  It sets up claims to countries on the left bank of the Upper Oxus that have exercised in recent times a virtual independence, but which appear to be much more intimately connected with the Afghan Turkestan province of Badakhshan or Koonduz than with Bokhara."
