#### Early Life

- Aini spent his childhood between two villages that were quite distinct from one another: Soktare (Соктаре) and Mahallai Bolo (Маҳаллаи Боло) (5-6).
    - Soktare was about a farsakh (8 km) away from Ghijduvan
        - Residents and ethnicity: "Бошандагони ин деҳа аз ҷиҳати ирқ ба номи тоҷикон, арабон, урганҷиён ва хоҷагон..." (5).  The khwajagon were further divided into four groups: "... асосан ба чор ҷамоа тақсим ёфта, хоҷагон ба номи миракониҳо, сайидатоиҳо, гиждувониҳо в соктариҳо - чор қабиларо ташкил медоданд (5). 
            - The Mirakon group is from Mashhad (5).
            - Despite the varying ethnicities, everyone speaks Tajik; the khwajagon and Arabs speak Uzbek (5).
        - Primary occupation was farming; the qazi and mutawalli families held privileged positions: "Бештарини заманҳои милки ин деҳа аз миракониҳо дар дасти ду хонавода буд, ки онҳоро қозибачаҳо ва мутаваллиҳо мегуфтан" (5).
            - Most of the others toiled on the lands held by this family; landlessness, poverty, and orphans were a problem (5).
        - The Khwajagon served as prayer readers and cured the sick (5).
        - Soktare did have a madrasa; as a result the people were very sophisticated: "Бинобар ин дар он давру пеш аз он деҳа маданиятноктар ва серхату саводноктар ҷое набуд (6).
        - Aini's father and grandfather were from the Khwajagon of Soktare (6).
    - Mahallai Bolo was also about 8 km / 1 farsakh from Ghijduvan, in this case to the northwest.  It was located in the tuman of Шофирком located in a desert (6).
        - Some of the land in this village was waqf land to the Mir-i Arab madrasa (6).
        - There were a few very rich individuals in this village - everyone else was dirt poor (6).
            - And the rich people did not even pay taxes: "Бойҳои калон... аз ҳосили замини худ ба подшоҳӣ андоз немедоданд, ё ин ки бисёр кам медоданд, чунки онҳо ба ҳокимон - амлокдорон наздик буданд..." (6).
        - Cottonpicking was the major occupation in this village (7).
        - Aini's maternal grandfather and uncles were from this village (7).
- Aini's father was Sayyid Murodkhoja and his grandfather was Sayyid Umarkhwaja.  Both were highly educated; their trade was carpentry (7).
    - When the Mahallai Bolo masjid fell down Sayyid Umarkhwaja was called upon to help rebuild it; since he was well-educate, his grandfather also carved the Islamic inscriptions into the mosque (7).
    - When they saw that Aini's grandfather was literate, they asked him to serve as their imam since the former imam was illiterate (7).
    - Aini's grandfather engaged in a variety of professions to get by: imam, guesthouse operator, carpenter.  "... барои ӯ дар аввали кор меҳмонхонаи Ҳамрохон номро, ки ҳавлиаш дар ҳамсоягии масҷид будааст, бошишгоҳ қарор додаанд" (8).
    - Aini's father also studied in Bukhara (8).
    - Aini's grandfather chose a bride for his father - Зеварой - from the Ҳамрохон family, who were a middling class / peasant family (8).
        - Aini's father died only two years after the marriage (9).
        - Note that despite the Bukharan education and workigng as a mudarris, Aini's father still worked as a weaver and farmer as well (9).
    - The family divided its time between the two villages - summer in Soktare and winter in Mahallai Bolo (9).
