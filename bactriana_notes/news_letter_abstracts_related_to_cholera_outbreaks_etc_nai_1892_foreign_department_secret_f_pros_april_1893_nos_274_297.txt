    - "*4th January 1893*. - Usman Khan* [asterisked note: "Probably a Russian frontier police officer. (Sd.) N.E.") captured three Turkomans near Maruchak, and on searching their persons and saddle-bags he found three letters secreted in their long boots.  The letters were written by the Ishans and elders of the Sarik tribe to the Ishans and elders of Maimena, and the purport was as follows: - 'You and we belong to the same religion.  You are Mussalmans and we are also Mussalmans.  We inform you in the name of God, the Prophet and the four Caliphs that the Russian Government are not a good Government. They are great tyrants.  During the cholera epidemic they set fire to a large number of houses belonging to Mussalmans and burned their property.  They are yearly imposing enhanced taxes on the people of Ashkabad, Merve and Sarakhs, and their tyranny has reached its climax.  Take care lest you should offer your allegiance to the Russians and be deceived.  If you do so you will lose your country, your ruler and your religion, and will not see a happy day, and will become captives of the infidels.  We have given you warning to please God and the Prophet, but you may do as you like.  Peace be upon you." (1-2).
        - "Usman Khan brought the letters together with the three Turkomans to the Governor of Panjdeh who imprisoned the three men and telegraphed the matter to Ashkabad." (2).

    - Russian Persianate subjects as a geopolitical tool: "The body of a Russian subject, who had been previously murdered by strangulation, was taken out of a well inside the town the other day. The Russian Consul-General has taken up the case, and says that he knows that the Persians have some hostile intentions against the Russians, as they constantly murder their subjects, several of whom have up to the present disappeared in this town."

    - The active currency in Meshed is the rouble: "Some of the Ulema of Meshed are objecting to the currency of rouble and other notes in Khorasan on the grounds that they have no real value, and as one individual is not responsible for them, they are illegal, and it is against the laws of the Shia religion to deal in them.  The matter was referred to Agha Mirza Hasan Shirazi, the Hujat-ul-Islam [asterisked note: "The chief Shia Mujtahid at Najaf (Sd.) E.R.T."] for orders, and His Holiness has decreed that in case notes are things in trust (amanat), it is lawful to deal in them, but that otherwise they are illegal.  Some of the Mullas of Meshed are of opinion that notes do not come under the heading of things in trust, but no final conclusion has yet been arrived at." (3-4).
