See also E. Shuiler" / Schuyler, "Na skol'ko dostoverny razskazy Vambery o Srelnei Azii (Turk. Sbornik T. 81, p. 437; Znanie, 1873, No. 10).  There is actually tons of debate  over the veracity of Vambery's journey - see Turkestanskii Sbornik Ukazatel' 1 starting on p. 19.

About the author and his quest:

- Born in Hungary in 1832; became interested in Oriental languages - i.e. trying to figure out what branch Hungarian belonged to (vii).
- Spent several years in Istanbul, then decided to travel to Central Asia disguised as an effendi (viii).
- "My attention was for the most part directed to the races inhabiting Central Asia, of whose social and political relations, character, usages, and customs I have striven, however, imperfectly, to giver a sketch in the following pages" (viii).
- High adventure: "... I wandered about for months and months with only a few rags as my covering, without necessary food, and in constant peril of perishing by a death of cruelty, if not of torture" (xiii).

Getting ready to depart

- Turkey vs. Iran: "... Iran, the theme of so much poetic enthusiasm, is, after all, nothing but a frightful waste, whereas Turkey is really an earthly paradise" (23).
    - "The Persian can boast a poetic organization and an ancient civilization.  The superiority of the Osmanli results from the attention he is paying to the langauges of Europe, and his disposition gradually to acquaint himself with the progress that European savans have made in chemistry, physics, and history" (23).
- Dost Muhammad was laying siege to Herat, where Vambery was heading: "Persians themselves dared not venture their wares or their lives; but there would have been far more cause for apprehension in the case of a European, whose foreign lineaments would, in those savage Asiatic districts, even in periods of peace, be regarded by an Oriental with mistrust, and must singularly displease him in time of war" (26).  This is the reason he disguised himself as a dervish.
- Ottomans and the Hajj: "It is an old custom of the Turkish embassy to accord a small subsidy to the hadjis and dervishes, who every year are in the habit of passing in considerable numbers through Persia toward the Turkish empire... The consequence was, that the hotel of the embassy received guests from the most remote parts of Turkestan" (28).
- Orientalism: "Words so unselfish proceeding from the mouth of an Oriental much surpised me" (29).
    - "The Oriental does not understand the thirst for knowledge, and does not believe much in its existence" (32).
- Tajiks vs. Uzbeks: "The hostility of the Osbeg (Tartar) tribes of CEntral Asia to the Tadjiks (the ancient Persian inhabitants) had long previously been known to me..." (31).
- Bukhara's bad rep: "... Bokhara, the only city in CEntral Asia that I really feared from having learned the unhappy lot of the travelers who had peceded me tither" (32).
- How Vambery gets in with the Dervishes: "I told them, for instance, that I had long silently, but earnestly, desired to visit Turkestan (Centra Asia), not merely to see the only source of Islamite virtue that still remained undefiled, but to behold the saints of Khiva, Bokhara, and Samarcand" (32).

The Expedition Begins - Turkmen Lands

- Impression of his traveling companions (numbering 23): "... they are in reality the most honest people I shall ever meet with in those parts" (42).
- Heh - His disguise as a dervish does not really fool anyone; they can tell from his skin that he is high-born (51).
- Author runs into geopolitics before even getting out of Iran: Afghans and Turkmens in service of the Russians.  "How great, then, was my astonishment when I learned that this Afghan was ready for the voyage; that he would allow the hadjis to accompnay him, but that he objected bo my highness, whom he regarded as a secret emissary of the sultan, fearing lest he might lose his meanso f subsistence from the Russians should he venture to take such an individual on board his vessel" (54).
- More orientalism: "The Oriental, and particularly the Islamite, bred up in lies and treachery, always believes the very contrary of what a man shows particular earnestness in convincing him of..." (55).
- Russians and the Turkmen problem: "The Russian government makes, naturally, the greatest exertions and at the greatest cost to paralyze the predatory habits of the TUrkomans... The Russian ships cruise incessantly day and night in the Turkoman waters..." (60).
    - Southernmost Russian possession: Ashourada.
    - Turkmens in the Russian service: "Khidr Khan still continued to live in a tent in the middle of the semi-European colony; his functions consisted in using his influence with the TUrkomans generally to prevent their piracies, or at least in conveying ot the Russians intelligence of any intended expedition... This Khidr Khan, though once so good a Mussulman, had formed at an early date acquaintance with the genreous vodki (Russian brandy)..." (61).
- Slavery: Not so relative a term?  "... a Persian slave, heavily laden with chains..." (70).
    - "I was astonished to find how many of my fellow-travelers, the poorest of the poor, in spite of the noble hospitality of which they had been partakers, were already weary of the Turkomans; for it would be, they said, impossible for men having the least sentiment of humanity to be eye-witnesses any longer of the cruel treatment to which the wretched Persian slaves had to submit.  **True, the Persians are heretics, and they tormented us terribly in our journey through their country; bu twhat the poor wretches here suffer is really too much**" (81-82).
    - "No other termination to his sufferings than the payment of a ransom by his friends; and, failing this, he is liable to be sold, and perhaps __hurried off to Khiva and Bokhara__!" (82).
    - Describes the miserable state of Russian slaves, who die in captivity (105).
- "No other termination to his sufferings than the payment of a ransom by his friends; and, failing this, he is liable to be sold, and perhaps __hurried off to Khiva and Bokhara__!" (82)
- People begin to question his Dervish-ness, suspecting he is an Ottoman agent; but then never think he is European (78).
- Reach of the Bukhara madrassas: "I found particular advantage in the friendship of Kizil Akhond (his proper name was Mollah Murad), a Turkoman **savant** of high distinction, with whom I was upon the best footing and whose recommendtation procurred access for me everywhere.  Kizil Akhond had in his time, __when sudying in Bokhara__, fallen upon a work in the Osmanil Turkish language, a sort of comment or explanation of sentences and expressions in the Koran" (73).
- Interesting stuff about how the Turkmen use Greek bricks they find from Alexander's time to build a mosque (77).
    - Goes into local Alexander myths: "According to Kizil, the wall had been erected by the genii (djinns), at the command of the mighty sovereign Alexander.  **Alexander,** he said, **was a more pious Mussulman than we are, and therefore all subterranean spirits, whether they would or no, owed him allegiance**" (79).
- Even among the tribes, the mullah enjoys incredible respect: ""Nor was the difference great between the manner in which he was received in his own tents and those of strangers... Even in the settlments of hostile tribes he was not only treated with honorable distinction, but laden with presents..." (80).
- Vambery's is not a purely negative orientalism by any means.  One of the author's fellow hadjis was robbed in a mosque.  "After a long search in every direction, as no discovery was made, the ishan (priest) declared that he would at once utter his malediction upon the thief should he not restore the stolen property.  Before twenty-four hours had expired the conscience-stricken criminal came forward, bringing with him not only the stolen property, but a present as atonement.  I venture to recommend this practice to the London detectives as as a substitute for their present system" (80-81).
- These here parts have their own rules.  Author is about to buy himself a camel to cross the desert, "... but I was dissuaded by Hadji Bilal and Sultan Mahmoud, who remarked that an appearance of wretchedness calculated to excite compassion was the best guarantee for safety among these nomads...  They named several of the hadjis who were well provided with means, and who, nevertheless, for the sake of prudence, were obliged to wander on in rags and on foot " (87).
- The Khan of Khiva's defense is the desert itself; relates that years before a Farangi was taken to Khiva and managed to take notes of where all the wells were, which was a major security risk (118).
- Out of our minds (crossing the desert to Khiva): "This evening my appetite left me. I had not the slightest craving for even the smallest piece of bread: my sensations were those of extreme debility; the heat of the day was indescribable" (188).
- Alexander: "Quite out of breath, I fell down before the tomb, which was thirty feet long, and ornamented with rams' horns, the signs of supremacy in Central Asia" (140).
- Huge tombs: "The Orientals love to dignify their saints also with the attribute of bodily size.  In Persia I have remarked several giant graves; and even in Constantinople, on the Asiatic shore of the Bosphorous, on the so-called Mount of Joshua, exists a long tomb which the TUrks venerate as that of Joshua of the Bible, but the Greeks as that of Hercules" (140).
- Weak rule of the khans: "I made inquiries, and found that we were taking a circuitous way for the sake of security.  The Ozbeg met yesterday had warned us to be on our guard, for that the Tchaudors were in open rebellion against the khan, and that their alamans were often making forays on these frontiers" (147).
- Ethnicity: There is definitely an understood difference between Turkomans and Ozbegs. "Although they [Turkomans] have dwelt now several centuries side by side with the Ozbegs, they detest the manners and customs of the latter, avoid their company, and, alghouth of kindred origin and tongue, an Ozbeg is as much a stranger in their eyes as a Hottentot is in ours" (149-150).

Khiva

- "Had the Eastern poets turned their lyres here, they would have found a more worthy theme than in the horrid wastes of Persia!" (150).
- Khivan khan's reputation: "I was well aware that the Khan of Khiva, whose cruelty was displeasing to the Tartars themselves, would, in case he felt any distrust, become far severer to me than the other Turkomans.  I had heard that the khan was in the habit of at once making slaves of all strangers of doubtful character; that he had, not long before, so treated a Hindustani, who claimed to be of princely origin, and who was now, like the other slaves, employed in dragging along the artillery carriages" (151).
- Khiva and the hajj: "For years so numerous a troop of hadjis had not arrived in Khiva.  All stared us in astonishment..." (152).
- Function of the caravansarai (interesting): "In accordance with the custom of the country, we dismounted at the caravanserai.  This served also as a custom-house, where the new arrivals of men and merchandise are subjected to severe examination" (158).
- "My first step was to go to Shukrullah Bay, who, without filling any functions, occupied a cell at that time in the medresse of Mehemmed Emin-Khan, the finest edifice in Khiva" (154).
    - Shakrullah Bay's reaction: "In God's name, effendi, what induced you to come to this fearful country, and to come to us, too, from that paradise on earth, from Stamboul?" (154).
- Khan addresses public grievances personally: "... crowded with petitioners of every class, sex, and age.  They were attired in their ordinary dresses, and many women had even children in their arms, waiting to obtain a hearing; for no one is required to inscribe his name, and he who has managed to force his way first is admitted" (157).
- Power of the Ottomans: "... for my personal security, I had with me a firman, bearing at the top the tugra (seal of the sultan).  I then handed him my printed pass.  On receiving this sign of paramount sovereignty, he kissed it reverently, rubbed it on his forehead, rose to place it in the hands of the khan, and, returning almost immediately, told me to step into the hall of audience" (158).
    - LOL: "A man might place his life in jeopardy who should assert the fact that the sultan has head and beard shaved a la Fiesko, and clothes made for him at Paris by Dusetoye" (163).
    - Too good to make up: A Khivan asks the author "... whether the great sultan really had his each day's dinner and supper forwarded to him from Mecca, and whether they passed to his palace from the Kaaba in one minute.  Ah! if the good Ozbegs only knew how much Chateau Lafitte and Margot garnished the sovereign's table in the reign of Abdul Medjid!" (164).
- Author's attitude toward the Khivan khan: "When I found myself again alone within the four walls of my cell I drew a long breath, not a little pleased to find that the khan, who in appearance was so fearfully dissolute, and who presents in every feature of his countenance the real picture of an enervated, imbecile, and savage tyrant, had behaved to me in a manner so unexceptionable; and that, so long as my time permitted, I could now traverse the khanat in all directions unmolested" (160).	
- Functionality of the mosque: "What in Europ idlers seek in coffee-houses they find in Khiva in the courts of the mosques.  These have in most cases a reservoir of water, and are shaded by the finest palms and elm-trees" (164).
- Khan considers self to be a severe defender of religion: "The khan has affixed the punishment of death not only to adultery, but to other offenses against religion, so that in the first years of his reign the ulemas were even obliged to cool his religious zeal..." (168).
- Reports that many of the dervishes are opium addicts (183).  "In Khiva, beng is the favorite narcotic; and many are addicted to this vice, because indulgence in wine and spiritous liqours is forbidden by the Koran, and any infringement is a sin punished by the government with death" (184).
- Khiva - Bukhara road: "Although the way between Khiva and Bokhara had been described to me as a frequented one, we had as yet, wit hthe exception of the frontier-watchers and the nomads who were roaming about, not met a single traveler" (186).

Bukhara

- Government apparatus: "In Khakemir there are but 200 houses... We were obliged to pass the night here, that the tax-collector (Badjghir) and reporter (vakanuviz), informed of our arrival in accordance with the law, might be in a position to complete their report of search and examination outside the city.  The very same day a messenger went express, and the following one, very early in the morning, arrived three of the emir's officers, with faces full of official dignity and importance, to levy upon us the imposts and duties, but more especially to learn tidings concerning the adjoining countries" (199).
    - There is a bureaucratic apparatus at work here (where it its paper trail?) - "... Hadji Salih gave him explanations as to my rank, my character, as well as the object I had in view in my journey, all of which he noted down carefully, accompanying the act with a look at me and a shake of the head full of meaning.  When th ecollector had finished with us, the functions of the vakanuvisz (writer of events) began.  He first took down the name of each traveler, with a detailed description of his person, and then whatever information or news each might have it in his power to give" (200).
- The Tekkie Vambery stays at in Bukhara: "I had fallen, without having remarked it, upon the chief nest of Islamite fanaticism in Bukhara... in the tekkie the emir's orders were inoperative" (204).
- Merchandise at the bazaar: "I kept close to my companions, casting as I passed glances at the booths, which contain, with a few articles from the other countries in Europe, fancy goods and merchandise, more especially of Russian manufacture" (207).
- Description of the Naqshbandi: "... dervishes of the order of the Nakishbendi, of whom this city is the place of origin and the principle abode.  Never shall I forget that scene when those fellows, with their wild enthusiasm and thier high conical caps, fluttering hair, and long staves, danced round like men possessed, bellowing out at the same tiem a hymn, each strophe of which was first sung for them by their gray-bearded chief" (210).
    - *Naqshbandi... singing and dancing?*
- Comparing Bukhara and Khiva: "They praised me, but not a farthing did I ever get from them; and the semblance of sanctity in this nation presented a singular contrast with the genuine piety and benevolence of the Khivan Ozbegs" (212).
- Conolly and Stoddart: "The sad fate of these two martyrs has continued to remain, as I remarked, a secret even in Bokhara..." (212).
- There is a book bazaar: "I then proceeded to the book bazar, which contains twenty-six shops.  A printed book is here a rarity" (215).
- Guinea worm in Bukhara? "... but another circumstance doubled my sufferings - the apprehension of the rishte (filaria Medinensis), by which, during the season, one person in ten is attacked.  This obliged me to be continually drinking warm wateror tea.  This affection is quite usual, and is treated with as much indifference by those residing in Bokhara during the summer season as colds are with us;.  one feels, at first, on the foot, or on some other part of the body, a tickling sensation, then a spot becomes visible whence issues a worm like a thread.  This is often an ell long, and it ought some days after to be carefully wound off on a reel.  This is the common treatment, and occasions no extraordinary pain; but if the worm if broken off, an inflammation ensues, and instead of one, from six to ten make thier appearance, which forces the patient to keep his bed a week, subjecting him to intense suffering.  The more courageous have the rishte cut out at the very beginning.  The barbers in Bokhara are tolerably expert in this operation." (218-219).
- Bukhara the city and Islam: "I often heard it affirmed that **Bokhara is the true support of Islam.** The title is too weak; it should rather be termed the **Rome of Islam,** since mecca and Medina are its Jerusalem.  Bukhara is aware of her superiority, and plumes herslelf upon it in the face of all other nations of Islam; yes, even before the sultan himself, who is yet acknowledged as the official chief of religion; but he is not so readily pardoned for having suffered so much to be corrupted in his territories by the influence of the Frenghis" (220-221).
    - *Khiva, which is not competing for Islamic cred., revers the Sultan, while Bukhara holds itself superior*
- Administration: the Rais. "Each city has its reis, who, with a cat-o'-four-tails in his hand, traverses the streets and public places, examines each passer-by in teh principles of Islamism, and sends the ignorant, even if they be gray-bearded men of threescore years, for periods varying from eight to fourteen days, to the boy's school; or he drives them into the mosques at the hour of prayer" (222-223).
    - "Every trace of gladness and cheerfulness is banished from those circles where the influence of religion and the system of surveillance are so tyrannically felt.  The emir's spies force their way even into the sanctuaries of families, and woe to the man who permits himself to offend against the forms of religion or the authority of the sovereign" (223).
- Religiosity of Amir Muzaffar al-Din Khan: "He carries out strictly the political principles of his father, adn in his capacity as mollah and pious Musulman is the declared enemy of every innovation, even when he may be convinced of its utility" (224).
    - Portrays the lifestyle of the amir as extremely austere, destroying palaces instead of seizing them.  "The expression **princely table** is inapplicable to Bokhara, where one and the same dish satisfies prince, official, merchant, mechanic, and peasant" (227).
