"Departure of Abdul Ghafur Beg for Turkestan.  From Government, Punjab, No. 565, dated 12th July 1883."

- "This is for information only.  Abdul Ghafur Beg recently asked for a passport, which was refused by the Government of India.  He has now left India for Turkestan, without even asking for travelling expenses, an application which Commissioner anticipated would be sure to be made.  He gave out that he intended going to the Russian authorities, and asking for forgiveness for his past faults; but the Punjab news-writer suspects that his proceedings will not be straightforward."
- (cont.) "Abdul Ghafur Beg is accompanied by some of the men who recently brought letters from Khokand to Abdul Karim Khan and the Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab.  He also had an interview with Syud Abdul Malik Tura, the Bokhara Prince at Peshawar, and is taking with him letters from the Prince to certain Chiefs, Raieses and Military officers in Bokhara."

"No. 176. Copy of translation of a news-letter from F.B., Peshawar, to the Secretary to the Government of the Punjab, dated 2nd July 1883."

- "On th e28th of June last, Abdul Ghafur Beg, Diwan Begi, with his son and ten other persons left Peshawar for Turkistan.  Among the men with him are the five persons who had brought letters from the grandees of Khokand for the Commissioner of Peshawar and His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor, which letters were returned to them without any reply to their contents.  As directed by Government, Sayid Abdul Karim Khan (the Khokand Prince at Peshawar) told them that no reply would be given them. Sayid Abdul Malik Tora (the Bokhara Prince) discussed matters with the Diwan Begi before starting for Abbottabad, and he has now sent him a number of letters for delivery to certain Raises, Chiefs and Military officers in Bokhara and its dependencies.  The Diwan Begi told the British authorities that he intends to go to the Russian authorities and ask forgiveness for his past faults, but he is a very mischievous person, and he was @@the chief cause of the ruin of Khokand, Bokhara@@, &c., it is very likely that he will play some tricks to gain the favor of the Russians and obtain permission to re-settle in his country."
