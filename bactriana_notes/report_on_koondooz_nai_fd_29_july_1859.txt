- From Captain Hugh R. James, Commisioner and 
- "3d. About two centuries ago the country north of the Oxus and east of Bokhara was divided into numerous independent Ozbek states, one of the principal of which was that of Hisar, under a chief named Marad Beg of the [Kutaglum].  His son, Mahomed Khan,..." (5).

p. 6

- (cont.) The Khanate of Koondooz, originally in Hisar: "... Khan Beg, being driven out of that state by the King of Bokhara, crossed the Oxus and seized possession of Huzrut Imam, [Talikan], and Koondooz, founding the state of that name, which with some intervals of dispossession has remained in the hands of his descendants to the present day." (6).
- (cont.) Nadir Shah: "4th In 1740 [Huzree Beg] of the same family drove the ruling chief into the Eastern hills, and was confirmed in the chiefship of Koondooz by Nadir Shah, to whom he submitted himself at Balkh" (6).
- (cont.) De jure independence: "5th Shortly afterwards the state of Koondooz was annexed by Ahmed Shah Dooranee, and formed part of th eAfghan Government of Bulkh.  In 1785, an Ozbek Chief named [Kooat?], who had received from Tymoor Shah the Government of [Narin], a District in Koondooz, to the South East of the city of that name, revolted from the Afghan yoke; and not only assumed the chiefship of Koondooz, but spread his conquest over Badakhshan and some of the Dependencies of Bulkh... When Tymoor, in 1789, marched against Bokhara, he received the nominal sumission of [Kooat] Khan, but this was ignored on the return of the former to Cabul" (6).
- (cont.) Expansion and consolidation of the kingdom of Kunduz: "6th Many changes followed, and finally in 1815 [*note: this must be 1855; see [[Tarikh-i Badakhshan (1913)]]*]  Mahomed Morad Beg, a lineal descendant of the chief of the same..." 

(p. 7)

- (cont.) "... same name, mentioned in para 3, successfully asserted the supremacy of his family; and under him the Koondooz state attained its highest prosperity, for he included in his dominions Badakhshan, Bulkh, some Districts to the North of the Oxus, and all the country between that river and the Hindu Koosh.  This was the ruler with whom our officers were acquained during our intercourse with Goorkistan.  He seems to have been a noted marauder, devoting his life to schemes of plunder and annexation.  He would bring the people of the countries he conquered to the unhealthy swamps of the Oxus, where they died in thousands, their places being soon taken by others" (7).
- (cont.) Contraction of the realm: "7th Mahomed Morad beg was succeeded some few years ago by his son the present ruler, Allabeek Khan, a man of small ability, and for whom no great fear or respect is entertained. He has gradually lost the chief part of his father's possessions; those to the West having fallen again to the Afghan Governor of Bulkh, which Badakhshan and the Trans Oxus states have regained their independence.  His present dominions comprise only the three Districts of Koondooz, Huzrut Imam, and [Talikan], and these he now seems likely to lose, unless Bokhara as the Chief Ozbek Power interferes in his behalf" (7).
- (cont.) Ethnic details: "8th The population consists of Ozbeks and Tajiks.  The former are chiefly of the [Kutaglum] tribe,..." 

(p. 8)

- (cont.) "... tribe, and they occupy the Northern part of the province, including the Towns of Koondooz, Huzrut Imam, and Talikan.  The Tajiks are generally supposed to be of Persian origin, and were in possession of the country before the Ozbek conquered; they still maintain this independence in some of the neighboring Districts, as Chitral, Durwaz [?], but in Koondooz they occupy only the Southern portion towards the Hindoo Koosh, including Baghlan, [Anderah], Khost, and [Gering?].
- (cont.) "9th They naturally hate their Ozbek rulers, and they have a special grievance in the cruel perseverance displayed by the late Ameer in transplanting colonies of them to the pestilential fens of the Oxus.  In para: 4 of the Diary which accompanied No 93 of 2d [Instant], the Mullicks of Khost and Anderah are reported to have sent a messenger to Dost Muhomed, informing him of the pleasure with which they threw off the Ozbek yoke; and with reference to the preceding remark it seems quite natural."
- (cont.) Ethnic rivalry explanation for Afghan march on Kunduz: "10 On this account probably the Afghans made a detour to the South, instead of continuing along the line of the Oxus from [Yash Qoorghom] to Koonduz, knowing that they would meet with less opposition, and expecting the country people to favor them.  Having occupied the Southern portion, it remained open to the Ameer to pursue his successes or not, as might best suit his policy."

(p. 9)

- Nomadic peoples: "11th Besides the above races, there are several nomad tribes who visit parts of the province periodically with their flocks: and the population altogether is estimated at 20,000."
- (cont.) Revenue: "The Meer derives his revenue partly from the produce of agriculture, and partly from taxes on  pasture.  Both are taken in kind, the farmer at the rate of one tenth, the latter at one fiftieth of the stock annually.  The sheep of the country are celebrated, being the broad tailed species of Doombah.  Agriculture is not extensive, except in the proximity of the river.  Formerly the ruler of Koondooz collected transit duties on the road from Cabul to Bokara, but this is now within the Afghan border; the only other items remaining to him being a horse tax arbitrarily assessed, and a tax on the gold washings of the streams.  The whole of his income may amount to about 2 lakhs per annuum 
- (cont.): "13th It is not therefore from its intrinsic value that the Ameer desires to possess the province, but partly from its...

(p. 10)

- (cont.) "... its being an ancient dependency of Afghanistan, and partly to strengthen his position on the Oxus, with reference, it may be to ulterior view."
- (cont.) Military forces: "14th The force at the disposal of the Ameer is the Militia of the country, who are nearly all horsemen.  Every chief holds his estate in Office under a Military tenure, and is bound to maintain a certain number of horsemen, properly mounted and equipped. He again apportions this number amongst the houses under his authority, from 5 to 10 houses being required to furnish and maintain a horseman.  Small presents and a share in plunder, are the perquisites to which these men look.  About 3/4 of this Militia are Ozbeks, and 1/4 Tajiks; it may number 8,000 in all."
- (cont.) More on the military: "15th The horses are small, but good, notoriously capable of sustained exertion: they are so reared as to be able to work for several days on the most scanty allowance of food.  Such a force, though admirably suited for predatory aggression, is not calculated to oppose regular troops, even such as the Afghans can bring against them.  The only effectual way of employing them on such occasions is in surprises, cutting off supplies, and generally harassing the enemy.  This style..."

- (cont.) style of warfare they were apparently about to commence, from the account given in the accompanying Diary of Sahib Nuzar's proceedings: but it was too late.

"Extracts from the Diary of Moonshee Gopal Das at Cabul. From 28th May to 3rd June 1859" (p. 13-16):

- "On 1st June I ascertained from Mirza Ahmed Khan / Mahomed Afzul Khan's agent at Cabul / that on the previous day letters had arrived from the Sirdars, reporting that the towers of Ghorai: Baghlan, Anderah, Khost, and other places in those parts, which had formerly been under the Government of Afghanistan, were now in their possession; the Meer of Koondooz holding the city of that name, Huzrat Imam, and [Galikan], whith a large force.  The Sirdars report that the Meers intention is to fight to the last for those places which have never been under Afghan domination; and they therefore solicit orders" (15).
- What it will take to seize Koondooz: "Mahomed Afzal Khan writes that if the Ameer will send him a reinforcement of four thousand men, he will take possession of the whole of Koondooz, and will not ask for further help, but will allow this body to return after a year.  In event of the Ameer not considering it advisable to send more troops, he begged for an early reply, that he might not commit himself with the Meer of Koondooz" (15).
- (cont.) Amir decides to go ahead and invade: "After the perusal of these letters, the Ameer went to the house of Sirdar [Dovttan] Mahomed Khan, and sending for the other Sirdars, held a council.  It was finally determined that a reinforcement of four thousand men should be sent.  No officer has yet been name for the Command, but the arrangements will be quickly made" (16.)
