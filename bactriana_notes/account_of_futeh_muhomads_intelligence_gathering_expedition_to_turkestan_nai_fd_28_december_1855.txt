## Foreign Department 1855, Secret, Consultation 28 December, No. 48

No [C] 127
From: Major H. B. Edwardes [C. B.], [Commissioner] and Superintendent, Peshawar Division
To: R. Temple Esquire, [Secy.] to the Chief Commissioner for the Punjab
Dated Abbottabd 19 [izara?] District, the 6th September 1855

Premise - A British agent in Turkistan: "Sir, In the spring of 1854, the Chief Commissioner may remember replying to a letter from the Ex. Meer Walee of Khooloom (Muhmad Ameer Khan).  2 The Bearer of the Ex Meer Walee's letter, and of the Chief Commissioner's reply, was a man named Futteh Muhomad, a Jawan Sher Kuzzilbash, native of Cabul, but for the last 5 years resident of Peshawar.  3 On his way back with the Chief Commissioner's reply, Futteh Muhammad called upon me, and asked if he could do any service, and finding him to be well acquainted with Toorkistan, and to have the protection of the Ex Meer Walee of Khoolloom, I engaged him to make a tour through Toorkistan, and more particularly, to go to Khiva and ascertain the exact position of the Russians on that frontier.  4 Futteh Muhomud has now returned, after a journey of 14 months, during which he visited Budukhshan, Koondooz, Kawadian, Bookhara, Bulkh and Khoolloom, Merve, Shiruksh, Mushed, Herat, Maimunna, Khooloom again, and Cabul, and I have now the honor to submit for the information of the Chief Commissioner the information brought back by him, as noted in the margins.  5 These documents will be found full of interest, giving a distinct and reliable account of the [current] state of many countries beyond the borders of Afghanistan, as observed by an eye witness of considerable intelligence, and more than ordinary fidelity of narrative" (1-2).

- From margins: "Enclosures: No 1 Narrative of Futteh Muhomud's Journey; No 2 Letter from the ruler of Koondooz; No 3 [Do] from Sirdar Mohomud Alim Khan of Cabul (nephew of the Amir)" (2).
- (cont.) Current geopolitical situation: "6 The narrative leaves a lively picture on the mind of the imminent dissolution of Toorkistan, its eak Ozbeg chiefs too jealous to combine, and three formidable foreign powers, the Russians, the Persians, and the Afghans, scrambling for its defenseless provinces" (3).
- (cont.) The strength of Persia: "7 The extraordinary advances made by Persia, in annexing Shirukhs and Merve, and even setting up a new King in its own interest on the throne of Khiva, to say nothing of its subsidizing Kandahar, and putting pressure on Herat..." (3).
    - "8 It is a most fortunate circumstance that Futteh Muhomud was an eye-witness of the destruction of the Khan of Khiva's force by the Persians at Shirukhs, and his account is the fullest we have yet obtained of that event" (4).
    - *Qajars installed a puppet khan in Khiva?*
    - "22 We have learned from Futteh Muhomud that Ubdaollah Khan who has been set up by the Persians on the throne of Khiva is a nephew of the murdered Imam Koolee Khan..." (8).
- Independent khanate in Badakhshan: "The King of Budukhshan desires a treaty with the English (p. 4) [as does] his neighbour the ruler of Rosstaq (p. 6).  So, clearly, does the ruler of Koondooz, threatened as he is with annexation to Cabul (p. 7 & 23). Indeed it appears that in every state of Toorkistan a despairing kind of wish is felt that the English rather than the Persian, Russian, or Afghan conqueror, were at the door (p. 42)" (5).
- Colonial attitude: "14 As a question of humanity we can never feel much pity for flesh dealing Toorkistan - let it fall to whom it may" (6).
- Bukhara ganging up with Russia vs. Khoqand: "Futteh Muhomud himself says a Russian officer from the garrison of Ak Masjid at Bookhara, and the King of Bookhara marched immediately afterwards with a large army to Oratippah on the Kokan border: as was generally supposed, to cooperate with the Russians against Kokan (p. 11& 27). This was about 4 months ago" (6).
- Balkh, Khulum, and great power trade rivalry: "18 The chief of Kawadian (between Balkhand Bookhara) expressed a belief to Futteh Mohomud, that Russia [meditated] establishing herself at Bulkh, by the aif of Bokhara (p. 20).  Bulkh and Khulum are the great depots of Russian and indian commerce, the points where the goods of Moscow and Manchester meet and contend for the custom of Toorkistan (p. 43)" (6-7).
- The chief of Kawadian, Abdool Ruhim Khan became irritated that the British sent a letter to the former chief of Khulum rather than the current chief of Kawadian (7).
- British prisoners: "20 The ruler of Koondooz has got 3 women and 3 men of our broken Cabul army at his capital, and continually offers to send them, but never does so.  He also thinks he has found traces of two Englishmen on th eborder of Koondooz and Budukhshan, and promises further intelligence (para 7, and his letter enclosure no 2)" (7-8).
- Borderlands between Persia, Bukhara, and Khiva: "23 Futteh Muhomud gives a good account of the political relations of the border provinces of Merve, Shirukhs and Mainama.  For the last 15 years, from which we learn that through Merve and Shirukhs both belonged to Khiva, they have been for the above period dependent on Bookhara and have now finally sold their liberty to Persia (30, 31, and end of 33) while Mainama which has hitherto belonged to Herat, is now desired by its suzerain to ally itself with Persia (p. 35) but is doutbful whether it were not more prudent and less odious to submit to Cabul (para 40)" (8-9).

#### Futteh Muhammed'sTravel Narrative
"Narrative of a journey through Toorkistan made by Futteh Muhummud by order of Major H. B. Edwardes, C. B. Commissioner and Superintendent Peshawar Division" (15).

- Futteh was detained for two months in Chitrar on suspicions of being an "emissary of the Sahibs."  Also: "The reason of this was that Shah Ufzul had sent a man of his to you at Peshawar to get a maison and a carpenter", which was when his man spotted Futteh with the English at Peshawar (16).
- Futteh refers to Shah Ufzul as a "governor," but also illustrates his autonomy: "An envoy from Yoosoof Allee Khan Governor of Roostaq had been in attendance on Shah Ufzul Khan at Chitrar, with a view of making a negotiation between the two rulers" (16).
- Refers to "Fuzabad" as "the capital of Budukhshan" (17).
- King of Badakhshan seeking to negotiate with the English: "The King of Budukhshan was then glad to receive my visit [after Futteh mentioned he was sent by John Lawrence], and asked me whether he could come to a negotiation with the **Sahibs**.  I assured him of the possibility.  The king then said that when I should return from Khooloom he would give me his application for a treaty with the **Sahibs,** and dismissed me witha  present of a silken cloak" (17-18).
    - (cont.) More on the king of Badakhshan: "Meeree shah of Budukhshan was an intimate friend of Mohumud Ameer Khan, and had in his pay a force of 25,000 horse and foot, but no artillery.  He talked in Persian and Turkish" (18).
- Part of the reason the Mir of Rustaq wanted British support was to operate his artillery: "Here [in Roostaq] I halted three days, and found the King (Yoosoof Ali Khan) earnest to negotiate with the British Government.  He had 6 guns planted in the Fortress of Roostaq but no artillery men except for a few Hindustanees, who had but a [rote?] skill in working Guns.  On my departure he gave me 5 Rs for my travelling allowance" (18).
- Kunduz: "Shah Moorad Khan [of Kunduz] had 30,000 troops, one large cannon and 40 small sized.  The large cannon is larger than the Bhungee Wallah Cannon at Lahore.  Mohommud Moorad Beg, father of Shah Moorad had 40,000 troops" (19).
- From Kunduz Futeh goes to Khulum, which apparently required crossing the Oxus; the ruler of Khulum is "Mohammad Ameen Khan the Meer Wallee of Khooloom" (20).
- After 40 days, the Mir Wali of Khlum sends his own spies along with Futeh: "He then dismissed me and sent with me two of his [Motmids] Baba Khan and Koorban Shah, that they might learn the state of affairs at Bookhara" (20).
    - While Futeh was in Bukhara, however, Mir Wali fell afoul of treachery in an intrigue with his neighbors and was not heard from again: "Hukeem Khan ruler of Shiberghan wrote to Mohomad Ameen Khan that he had a rupture with Sirdar Mohommad Ufzal Khan son of Ameer Dost Maohmad Khan, and desired Mohomid Ameen Khan to come over to his assistance... But Hukeem Khan had secretly plotted with Ufzul Khan to capture Mohomid Ameen Khan..." (20-21).
- Bukhara: "11. Here I passed 3 months, but could not gather any account from the people who were much afraid of the King.  What I saw myself I beg to relate as follows" (22).
    - (cont.) Russian great game stuff: "A Russian in the disguise of a Persian merchant had arrived at Bookhara, remained one month there; and one day visited the King in private and then returned to his country.  The King was afraid to give him a public visit, lest the pople being Mahomedans might take offense (to see their Mahomedan King treating with the Christians of Russia) and kill him" (22).
    - (cont.) Assault on Uratippa: "10 days after the departure of the Russian Envoy, the King having collected a sufficient number of camels and carriages for baggage set out with an army of 30,000 strong and 12 pieces of artillery to Aratippah, a place 4 journeys distant from Bookhara.  The King likewise ordered the rest of the troops to proceed in his rear. Aratippah was formerly a dependency of Kokan, but was wrested from it by the King of Bookhara.  The rumour about this expedition was reported differently.  Some anticipated that it was undertaken against Kokan to act as principal; others as a mere ancillary of the Russian invasion" (22-23)/
        - Marginal note: "Aratippah is on the Kokan border of the upper road from Bookhara to Akmisjid" (22).
- After Bukhara Futeh returned to Gurkhurgan and then to Kawadian, where he took a raft down the Oxus to Merv, where he stayed a month (23).
- Khorezmian and Persian politics - "While I was at Shirukhs, a message from Imam Koolee Khan ruler of Orgunj arrived inviting the Shirukhsees and the Moors [marginal note - **Men of Merve**] (who were respectively 80,000 and 20,000 souls, or altogether one lakh) to make their allegiance to the ruler of Orgunj.  These men agreed to the invitation, on the condition that the King should in person visit their country.  He accordingly with 4,000 Horsemen marched to Shirukhs.  The Shirukhsees and Moors in the meantime invited over an Army of Persians from Mushid, consisting of 10,000 Horse and one Battery commanded by Mohomid Ali Khan, who encountered the Orgunjees and murdered the King and all his followers.  The Elephant that Mohomid Ufzul Khan had given to Imam Koolee Khan as a rarity, and on which he was mounted was also killed in the action.  14. The Persian General then nominated Abdooluh Khan, nephew of Imam Koolee Khan to succeed to the throne of Orgunj, to hold it as a dependency of Persia, and giving many assurances of favor to the Turkomans returned to Mushid.  These occurrences I witnessed with my own eyes" (24).
- From there he goes to Herat, reporting on the Persian interactions with the ruler of that province (25); then he goes to Balkh, but does not say much about it, then to Kabul (26).
- More great game rumors: "Ubduool Ruheem Khan of Kawadian was heard to say that the Emperor of Russia had written to the King of Bookhara to the effect that the Emperor would by no means meddle with the Government of Bookhara, but only wanted that it might allow his troops to pass through its jurisdiction to Esan and Deh Now on the banks of the Amoo with a view to establish his Cantonment there. The Emperor also determined to throw a bridge across the river, and capture Bulkh.  Abdool Ruheem Khan of Kawadian though in alliance with Bookhara was anxious to negotiate with the Sahibs" (28).

"Continuation of Statement of Futteh Mohomid: in reply to questions by the Commissioner" (31)

- Description of territories of Kunduz and Kulab: "Koondooz is at present independent of Cabul.  On the Road from Khooloom to Koondooz there are two villagess named [Ubdan]. The one nearest Khooloom belongs to Cabul, the other to Koondooz; and that is the boundary on the west.  On the East Koondooz joins Budakhshan at the pass of Kullloohghan.  On the South, the Koondooz Territory reaches to the Hindoo Koosh.  On the North, Huzrut Imam is the farthest possession of Koondooz: beyond which belongs to @@Koolab, which is also independent@@" (31). 
    - (cont.) " The chief of Koondooz is Shah Moorad Khan but the people never call him by his own name, but by the title of Attabekh, which is an old title given formerly by the Kings of Bookhara when Koondooz was dependent on them.  The Attabekh has no Foot soldiers, but levies the poeple en masse when there is a war.  He has 30,000 Oozbek Horse and 5 guns.  But unsupported he would have no chance with the Afghans.  However the Meer Shah of Budukhshan, and [Kumcheen] Khan of Koolal, and Abdool Ruheem Khan of Kawadian, have all sworn to assist the Attabekh; and if they do so, Sirdar Ufzul Khan will not prevail against them" (31-32).
    - very @@interesting@@ marginal note: "Note: The **Khootbeh** or Prayer for the Royal Family in all the Mosques of Koondooz is still put up in the name of the King of Bookhara.  The same in Koolab though also now independent.  In Budukshan many Moolahs think it should be so there.  But it is read now in the name of th eMeer-i Shah of Budukhshan, who claims to be himself a branch of the Royal Family of the Choghuttahs.  In Bulkh, Shibberghan, [Ludkho], and all the provinces conquered by the Afghans, Sirdar Ufzul Khan forced them to read the prayer in the name of th eAmeer of Cabul, whom they nevertheless call **Sahib**-i Zeman' or **Lord of the day** to signify they cannot help themselves and hope for a better day to come.  [Rsdt.?] H. B. Edwards, Commd & Support" (32).
- (cont.) Analysis of Afghan vs. Uzbek military prowess: "The strength of the Cabulees in their Guns and their Infantry.  But the Oozbek Horsemen are far superior to the Horsemen of Afghanistan.  An Afghan rolls about in his saddle - an Oozbek is part of his Horse, and he takes an Afghan out of the saddle with his spear, as you would take up meat with a spoon.  I have seen the battle of both of them; and I know that any Countrymen cannot stand before an Oozbek Horse" (33).
- (cont.) More on Kunduz: "Koondooz is a fat country - no one is poor there. You get a cake a yard long and four fingers thick for a pice.  Flocks and herds and [cosn] and gold are in abundance.  The people are Oozbeks of two branches, Moonass and [Kudghumm].  They are all right good Soonees and sell every Sheeah they get hold of into slavery.  They are ruled with a very tight hand; and are very happy. They on no account desire to pass under the Cabul yoke; which is awfully heavy on their brethren of Khooloom and Bulkh.  Under the Oozbek rule the revenue was 1/6th of the produce, and a few customs.  Now Sirdar Ufzul Khan takes 1/2 produce, and farms out monopolies of every thing.  The Oozbek subjects of Cabul are everlasting by putting up this prayer, 'May it please God to bring the English; or even the Hindoos; to rule over us" (33).
- Futteh speculates that if Cabul ever had the means to conquer Bukhara, they certainly would, "... for they have never forgotten the treacherous imprisonment of Dost Mohomid Khan" (34).
- More on Bukhara: "The key of Bookhara is Samarcand.  Samarcand is larger and older than Bookhara, but not so populous.  The (King) Huzrat of Bookhara spends 6 months at Bookhara and 6 months at Samarcand to keep the Samarcands quiet.  If Samarcand rebelled, Bookhara would rebel; for the people of Bookhara are at heart angry with the Huzrat whose debaucheries have dishonored every house.  Otherwise the Huzrat's rule is not oppressive.  he does not grind the people like Sirdar Ufzul Khan for instance" (34).
- (cont.) Intrigue between Samarqand, Bukhara, and Khulum: "25. The Ex Walee of Khooloom went to Samarcand under pretence of getting aid from the Huzrut to recover his country from the Afghans; but he employed himself secretly in winning over the Chiefs of Samarcand, and he would doubtless have opened a way for the Afghans to Bookhara.  He was a great man, Maohmid Ameen Khan, and he has not left his equal behind him in Tookristan" (35).
- (cont.) Shahrisabz: "26. I do not believe the report that an Envoy from Shuhr-iSubz came to Cabul with Sirdar Ufzul Khan at this last visit... Shuhr-i-Subz is on the road to Samarcand, and the King of Bookhara tries every year to reduce it, but he cannot. Just now there is a hollow peace patched up between them" (35).
- Description of Merv: "There are two Merves: old and new.  Old Merve was founded by Shahjehan, and is now entirely desolate.  Turkumans encamp there occasionally.  New Merve was founded by Nadir Shah and has 20,000 families.  It is inhabited by the [Zamoot, Sarook, and Gakha] tribes of Turkumans.  They are desperate slave dealers" (40).
    - History of political control of Merve: "30. When I was at Merve it was about March of this year (1855).  At that tie Merve was subject to Bookhara.  About 14 years ago it was subject to Orgunj an dI went to Merve that very year with a caravan.  Just before I arrived, the Morees revolted form the Khan of Khiva and killed no less than 100 of his soldiers in the Fort, and took two guns and invited the King of Bookhara to rule over them.  So the King sent a garrison and took possession and the Morees asked permission to have a certain Soofee enthusiast for their Governor, and was he was still in that office when I went there again in March" (41).
- Shirukhs as a city-state: "Shirukhs properly belongs to Khiva; but like Merve, it has long been in rebellion, and called itself a dependency of Bookhara; but @@in fact it was independent@@" (42).
    - "The Turkumans of Shirukhs are of the same tribes of those of Merve; and are 80,000 families" (41).
- Persian intrigue in Shiruks: "... the governor of Meshed had sent to the Shrukhsees 'If you entrap the King of Khiva into our hands, we will not only release to you your own chiefs, but we will also put Khiva itself under your rule" (42).
    - (cont.): "So the Shirukhsees wrote to the King of Khiva **come here and receive our submission.** The King believed them and came. A long with him came Juhandad Kkhan, a Vakeel of Sirdar Mohommid Ufzul Khan, who had gone to Khiva via Maimana and Merve, and taken an Elephant and handsome presents from Cabul to the khan" (42).
    - The Shirukhsees entertained the Khivan sultan outside the city and sent word to the Meshed governor to attack.  "Meanwhile 2 Guns and about 60 Horsemen had joined the Khan of Khiva from the rear; and suspissions began to be aroused in the Khiva Camp" (43).
        - In comparison, the Meshed forces "... were 10,000 strong with 10 Guns..." (44).
    - Seeing Qajar forces in the distance, "He [the khan of Khiva] told his soldiers to see they died like men. From early morning till past noon the fight went on, and whoever says the Orgunjees did not fight lies horribly. They fought to the death.  But what could they do, those 4,000? The Gunner were poor clumsy clowns.  Afghans picked up here and there and knowing nothing about Gunnery.  The Persian Guns were served right well" (44).
    - Taking the Khivan king alive: "The Orgunjees all fell, but the khan was taken alive and brought before the Kujjar. **Oho** said he, **so here you are; You have laid waste the borders of Persia for years and sold Persians into slavery without number.  Oh you son of a burnt father! We sent you word to come and side with us; and promised to have you undisturbed in your Khiva if you would only make your Salam to the Shah-in-Shah! but you would not. You must needs go and make friends with the Afghan!  And the Afghan has given you an Elephant, has he? very good now see here: you have fallen into my hands and there is an end of you!** So with that the little Persian ordered the King of Khiva stripped and killed... And not content with that, they brought out the poor Elephant, and chained his legs together, and then blew him to pieces with Artillery.  And then they beheaded the slain; and they loaded the 4000 heads on Camels and sent them off to Persia" (46).
    - The author, Futteh, went to Meshed.  There he reported the following: "About the 10th day 30,000 Persian soldiers arrived from Tehran, with orders to annex Shirukhs and Merve.  20,000 of them with Mohomid Alee Khan at their head marched at once upon those places, and established garrisons there, and are building Forts; and Caravans of supplies and ammunition followed them from Mushid.  The Turkoman fools of Shirukhs and Merve now have their eyes opened, and see what they have done.  They have shaken off a Soonee master, and got a Sheah tyrant instead" (47).
- Independent city-state of Herat: "Syid Mohomud Khan the ruler (son of Yar Mohomid Khan) is a long bearded, fair faced, half witted, debauchee.  He is in heart inclined to the Persians and his father's dying advice to him was to submit to Persia whenever there was a pressure on him; but never to put himself into the hands of Dost Muhomid Khan, who would strip him bare, and take both Country and money from him" (48).
    - "There is always a Vakeel from Cabul at Herat, but not openly.  He goes there in the character of a servant of the wife Sirday Hydar Khan, who is sister of the ruler of Herat.  Out of fear of Persia he is not called a Vukeel.  The present Vukeel is Syud Buhadoor Shah" (50).
    - "Most of the revenues and monopolies of Herat are farmed out to two Kizzilbash brothers, natives of Cabul, named Mirza Hossein and Mirza Alta.  I put up at their house, and they were very kind to me" (44).
    - "The present prince is too mad to do any thing for his own good.  The whole business of the state is carried on by the Beebee Sahib, widow of Yar Mohomud Khan, one of the ablest women alive.  She is not the mother of Syud Mohomud Khan, and she has a fair little boy of her own, the youngest son of Yar Mohomed, above 15 years old, whose name is Mohomud Suddeek.  But she does not try to set him up instead of Syud Mohomud.  She knows that while Syud Mohomud lives, and drinks, she reigns, and that is all she desires" (50).
        - "The Beebee Sahib is at heart as little inclined toward the Cabulalhainee as her son-in-law.  But she encourages Dost Mohomud Khan to keep a Vukeel there and plays fast and lose with him just to temporize with the difficulty" (51).
    - Dependencies of Herat: "35. Bala Moorghab belongs to Herat.  So does Punjdeh.  Maimanna also has always been a dependency of Herat, though it only sent a [Nuzzeranna] of a few Horses annually, and paid no revenue.  Now by the advice of Syud Mohomud Khan of Herat, who saw that Sirdar Mohomud Ufzul Khan in Balkh was mediating the annexation of Maimanna, Hookmat Khan, the Chief of Maimann has transferred his allegiance to Persia.  50,000 familes are under the rule of Hookmit Khan, Kipchak.  He is a regular Oozbeg and has no beard.  There are no Persian soldiers or officials as yet in Maimanna" (51-52).
- The conclusion of the age of city-states: "42. The Chiefs feel that their independence is fast drawing to a close.  They see the Persian influence seated in Khiva, Merve, and Shirukhs, and the Afghan daily encroaching on the Oxus, and they wish it could be that they might fall into the hands of the English whose words and justice is renounced" (56).
