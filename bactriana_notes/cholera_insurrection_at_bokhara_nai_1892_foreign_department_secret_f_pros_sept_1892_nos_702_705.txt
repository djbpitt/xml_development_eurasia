*file copied in its entirety*

Rumours were rife a short time ago that there had been an insurrectionary movement in Bokhara; so many incidents of this nature occur every summer in Central Asia that no one paid any special attention to these reports, but it is evident that the rising in question must have been more or less serious for the Imperial Government have deemed it advisable to send a semi-official communique to the Press, of which I have the honour to enclose a translation.

[margin: "Turkistan Gazette, translation"]  The rising is therein ascribed to the prohibition issued, at the request of the Russian Government, in view of the expected outbreak of cholera, to the inhabitants of the town of Bokhara to slaughter their cattle within the precincts of that city, and to the establishment of a special slaughter-house for the slaughtering of the cattle.  These measures caused great dissatisfaction to the natives and especially the butchers who were egged on to resist the enforcement of the same by the Mollahs.  The mob was, however, pacified by the native authorities, who explained that *the Russian Government had made a reasonable request* [note: italics from original], and that in no case would this request be recalled, as also that the people had better await the return of the Emir.  The latter reached Bokhara three days after the riot and immediately gave instructions for the strict fulfillment of the orders *issued at the request of the Russian government*, and threatened that the disobedient would be visited with capital punishment. This, states the communique, was quite sufficient to dispel the slightest opposition and for carrying out the measures considered necessary for improving the sanitary condition of the city of Bokhara.

As a matter of fact, I understand that the sanitary condition of that town was of the very worst kind, and that M. Lessar, the Imperial Diplomatic Agent to the Emir, has done his best to make His Highness improve the same with evidently excellent results, for during the present epidemic there has been but one case of cholera reported in that vicinity, and that occurred at the railway station which is at some distance from the town.

The Emir is most anxious to pay his respects to the Emperor at St. Petersburg; the visit has been postponed several times of late, owing to the fear that His Highness and his suite with tons of luggage, the purity of which was doubted, might bring cholera microbes with them; it was then suggested where he and his belongings might be thoroughly disinfected, but I see it is now announced in the press that His Highness may be expected at the capital towards the end of July.  It is more than probable, however, that the Emperor will dispense with the pleasure of the Emir's company until next year, or that all events until after the present epidemic has ceased.

#### No. 704
Translation from the Russian
The *Okraina*, a newspaper published in Samarkand, printed an article under the heading of "Insurrection in Bokhara," respecting the manner in which the measures prescribed for the sanitation of that town were received by the local population.  According to the information obtained by the *Turkestan Gazette*, the article in question was not a correct statement of the facts of the case, and the gazette gives the following version of it:- 

Among the measures which the administration of the Turkestan Region had determined to carry out in view of an expected outbreak of cholera were those which had for their object the improvement of the sanitary condition of populous places; these including the town of Bokhara with 70,000 inhabitants packed together on a  comparatively small area.  It was at the same time decided to prohibit the slaughtering of cattle by the inhabitants within the precincts of the town.  The Bokharian Government was accordingly recommended to take the necessary steps for the enforcement of this measure, and to construct a special slaughter-house for the slaughtering of cattle.  In all probability the necessity for this precautionary measure was not sufficiently explained to the people, and it was received with great dissatisfaction, particularly by the butchers and soap dealers, who considered the above sanitary orders injurious to their pecuniary interests.  The discontented natives accompanied by a crowd of idlers and some of the more fanatical mollahs, who in their religious blindness still hoped for a re-establishment of the Bokhara of old, proceeded to the place of abode of the Kush Begi in the fort, and when the mob was not allowed to penetrate to him they bent their steps to Kazy Kalian.  The latter called for a deputation from the mob and explained to it that the Russian Government had made a reasonable request, and that in no case would this request be recalled.  He then advised the people to await the return to Bokhara of the Emir, who had already, he said, reached Kermine, and to whom he would at once proceed.  The mob then dispersed and the Kazy Kalian went to meet the Emir, who reached Bokhara three days after the manifestation and immediately ordered a strict fulfilment of the orders issued at the request of the Russian Government, and threatened that the disobedient would be visited with capital punishment.  This was sufficient to dispel the slightest traces of opposition and for carrying into effect all the measures considered necessary for improving the sanitary conditions of Bokhara."
