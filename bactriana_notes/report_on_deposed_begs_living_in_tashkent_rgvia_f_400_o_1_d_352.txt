## РГВИА Ф.400 Оп.1 Дело 352 «По ходатайству Туркестанского Генерал Губернатора о выдаче содержании бывшим средназиатским бекам Джурабеку, Баба беку, Абдулгафар беку, Сеид Беку и Шады Беку” 21/11/1873-15/06/1874

ll.1- Kaufman to Miliutin 18/10/1873, outlining the backgrounds of the Beks

1) Jurabek ibn Koshandar Qari (Tarakly Keneges branch)

- Jurabek originated from a middling lineage, as a servant of Iskandar Bek.
- In 1852 Jurabek was taken prisoner near Samarqand and sent to Bukhara; though it was more like house arrest, as Nasrallah appointed him Tuqsaba and added him to his retinue.
- After the conquest of Shahrisabz, Nasrallah installed Jurabek in Kitab, under the command of Allayar Divanbegi.
- After Nasrallah's death, Muzaffar put Zakir Bek in charge of Kitab, and kept Jurabek there as well.
- Population rose up and - not seeing anyone from the previous line - installed Jurabek (wording important here).
- Muzaffar marched on Shahrisabz twice, but was unable to subdue the city either time.
- After the Russian defeat in 1870, Jurabek fled to Khoqand, where Khan Khudayar transfered him to Russian custody.

2) Bababek ibn Hakimbek (Agamashly Keneges branch)

- Bababek's father was appointed by Muzaffar to Shahrisabz (Шагар) in 1861, and was chosen as the beg of Shahrisabz as a result of the uprising in Kitab; after his death, Baba Bek was selected in his place.
- In 1865 he made an alliance with Jurabek of Kitab against Bukhara.
- In 1870 he fled to Khoqand along with Jurabek, and was given to the Russian government.

3) Abd al-Ghafur Bek Divan Begi ibn Muhammad Rahim

- Ancestors were the begs of Urateppa and Jizakh, both of which switched back and forth between Bukharan and Khoqandi control.
- During that time, Abd al-Ghafur's father was killed by the Khoqandi khan, and - penniless - Abd al-Ghafur took up residence in Urgut, where he lived for 30 years.
- Eventually Abd al-Ghafur submitted to Malla Khan of Khoqand, who appointed him commander of the "Nau / Нау" fortress in 1859.
- Abd al-Ghafur conquered Urateppa and then switched allegiances to Bukhara, where he fled after Russia conquered Urateppa.
- Bukhara but Abd al-Ghafur in charge of Urgut in 1867, only to be recalled after a week, and appointed Sarkardar. 
- He was then appointed by Bukhara to resist the Russian advance. So he went with the Amir's son to Qarshi, and from there to join forces with Shahrisabz, and from there to Samarqand and Urmitan. He fled from Urmitan to Shahrisabz.
- He flees all over the place, until accepting Russian protection in Samarqand.

4) Sayyid Bek ibn Allayar datcha (Ming tribe)

- Descended from begs who never submitted to Bukhara: отец его и дядя Аушбек Парваначи были беками в городах Кштуте, Ургуте и Магиан, по наследству своих предков, не подчинялось Бухаре
- Until Nasrallah, that is. Once Nasrallah conquered these cities, Sayyid Bek and his siblings were sent to Bukhara, where many of them were executed.
- After that point, Sayyid Bek and a few remaining siblings were sent to Charjuy under observation.
- After the Russian defeat, Muzaffar let (?) them resettle with their families in Shahrisabz; after the Russian conquest of Shahrisabz, he settled in Samarqand: После покорения русскими войсками Самарканда и Катта Кургана Музафар хан дал Сеид беку и Шады беку семействами собой воспользовавшись оною, они отправились в Шахрисябз и Джурабек назначил Сеид беком в Фараб в 1868 году, откуда после присоединения к России нагорных управлении, он с семейством перешел на жительство в Самарканд, где проживало до отправления в Ташкент.

5) Shadi Bek ibn Adil Bek Parma 

- Similar story to previous.
- Lived under Russian protection in Samarqand for a time, until the Russians sent him to Tashkent.

Concluding bits: 

Вышеупомянутые 5 беков около трех леть живуть в здешнем крае и надзор за ними в течении этого времени показал что они вполне подчинились своему настоящему положению.

Беки эти изъявив покорность и приняв покровительство русской власти, поселились в Ташкенте с своими довольно многочисленными семействами, и так как находясь долгое время на высоких должностях с хорошим содержанием от Среднеазиатских владетелей, и с неизвольными произвольными поборами с жителей в свою пользу, они привыкли к обезпеченному образу жизни, то при настоящем положении они терять большую нужду.'

l.5ob He has sometimes given them one-off payments, but now proposes pensions of 1200 roubles a year for Jura-Bek and Baba-bek and 600 for the other three. This is because the first two have large families, rather than because of any question of status.

l.7-ob War Ministry to the Ministry of Finance 13/12/1873 asking for the money

ll.8 – ob Ministry of Finance to the War Ministry 22/12/1873 saying they will only cough up 600 and 400 roubles respectively.

ll.11-ob Von Kaufman to the War Ministy 25/04/1874 Von Kaufman grudgingly agrees to this reduction, but suggests 750 for the first two and 300 for the others.
