## Interview with: Abd al-Ghafur Razzakov - 10 August 2014

Interview took place in his home with Nasriddin, conducted in Persian.

Interviewee had a tattoo, suggesting he served in the army.

- Studied in Mir-i Arab until 1975.  His teachers there studied in many different places before the Revolution.
- Madrasas were still in operation up to the early 1930s; they weren't all closed in the 1920s.
- At that point many fled.
- Presented a published, full color book of calligraphy from his personal collection.
- Dahyek: After graduating the madrasa the students would go to the group (jamoa) of qazis, who would then examine the students' knowledge from the Hidaya; those who were successful would get this money.
    - You could only get the dahyek in Bukhara.  For instance his teacher from Andijan did not receive the Dahyek, but his other teachers from Bukhara received it.
    - It was for 120 tanga.  The tanga was silver; this was good money.
    - This would also qualify you to become a mudarris.
- Hierarchy: At first after graduating you become a mudarris; a hire teaching rank is akhund (daraja-yi 'ilmi); then a'lam.  All of these ranks taught in the madrasa.
    - They could not act as a mufti (or qazi) until they achieved the rank of akhund or a'lam.
    - Rais was considered higher than a mufti.
- Shaykh al-Islam and Qazi al-Quzat were two separate ranks, but equal to each other.
    - The Qazi al-Quzat oversaw and appointed the raises and other qazis.  This was also a more political position.
    - The Syakh al-Islam was more concerned with documents.

From 13:24

- The hujras just dictated where the students would live. They moved around attending lessons in whatever madrasas they wished depending on what text they needed to learn.
    - The students themselves chose which lessons to attend based on what they needed to achieve and what specialists were teaching at the time.
- Mentioned Damulla Ikromcha, who was a specialist in fiqh; Abd al-Rashid was a specialist in Aqa'id.
- Mawlavi as a rank for completing the Hidaya or Sahih-i Bukhari is not a rank in Transoxiana; it was familiar as a South Asian rank.
- Prep school: Damullaha-yi Kunjakiy performed a kind of prepping service after maktab but before madrasa. They would pay for this privately.
- Most famous ulama in Bukhara: Damulla Ikromcha; Domulla Khāl'murad.
- Mufti-yi Askari was not a higher rank than other muftis, just more specialized.
- The madrasa education was entirely in Arabic.  There were a few books in Persian like the introductory Chahar Kitab; one of the authors of this book was Khwaja Atar Wali.
    - The language of instruction was Persian.
- Arabic qasidas were studied alongside Persian poetry to some degree.

From 30:30

- Said that the children of Indian merchants studied in Bukhara.
- Once the Mir-i Arab reopened in 1946, students did not return from Afghanistan. The borders were still closed. Contacts between families were limited to nonexistent.
- Once it reopened many of the students were from Khoqand, Tashkent.
- If you wanted a high rank in the emirate, you had to study in an Bukharan madrasa.  Also the dahyek was really important.
- Named Samarqand as a possible second best place for Islamic education; but after Bukhara it's really in other countries.
- Wasn't sure when the Dahyek originated, but thinks from the middle ages.  It means 1/10 of the khan's property.
- Said that the students in the hujras in Chorbakr slept there and then studied in Bukhara.
- Tasawwuf was not separated from the Islamic education; they were only recently separated into separate categories.
- Emphasized that the Naqshbandiyya were much more prevalent than other brotherhoods like the Qadiriyya or Yasawiyya.

From 40:00

- Jinn - if problems became to great, the Qazis would involve Qaris to recite the Quran repeatedly to exorcize the jinn.
    - Recently in Bukhara a person came to the interviewees home to ask for help because his own home had become haunted (ba khana-yi man hamin khayli muammo dosht. Shumo ba "m ch es" (minesterstvo chrezvychainiye situatia) murojat kuni, na ba man).  The interviewee went to the house to help but didn't specify what he did, just that he solved the problem.
- As far as the occult, he agreed that they were widespread before the revolution but - unlike poetry, which people continued to practice from privately held manuscripts - occult practices were widely forgotten.
    - He referenced a book called Shams al-Ma'arif for information on the occult.
    - His own teachers had studied the occult in their educations, but did not continue to teach them in the Soviet period.
- Modern falbinha, according to interviewee, exist for fitna.

From 1:00:00

- Reason the Kukaltash was so respected was because the salary was 250 tanga, as opposed to the usual 150.  This was why those with the rank of Akhund always wanted to teach there.
- Interviewee's silsila to the Yakka-Bagh prince-cum-calligrapher: Interviewee - Ghulamjan - Abdallah Bik "Yakkabaghi"
    - See [[Taẕkirat al-Khaṭṭāṭīn-i Mīrzā Muḥammad Sharīf al-Mutakhallas bil-Żīāʾ (al-Biruni 1304/III)]]
    - According to Ghulamjan, Abdallah Bik was very "daqiq nazar."  Sometimes he would spend two hours shaving a qalam (Abdallah Bik yak qalam ra du soat me taroshid).
    - Being his student was in high demand; everyone wanted to, but not everyone was able to.  He only accepted the very best students.
