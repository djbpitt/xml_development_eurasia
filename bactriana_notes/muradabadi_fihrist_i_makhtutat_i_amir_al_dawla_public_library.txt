## Muḥammad Shafīq Murād′Ābādī, ed., Fihrist-i Makhṭūṭāt (ʿArabī, Fārsī aur Urdū) (Lucknow: Amir al-Dawla Public Library, 2000).

No 15, p. 11: تواریخ قندهاری

- Accession (ایکسیشن نمبر): no. 48342
- 270 pages.
- Beginning pages are missing - which is problematic since the subsequent sections are highlighted by day, without a mention of year.
- I think this is actually about Babur and Humayun in Qandahar.

- Accession number: 48332
- 242 pages.
- Written in 1223 during the reign of Muhammad Shah, covering the period from Shahjahan up to Muhammad Shah Mughal.
