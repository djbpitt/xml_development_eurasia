From Ulfat:

One of the learned men of his time was Mawlana Sayyid Muhammad Akhund who wrote a history entitled Gulshan-i iqbäl about his (Shir Ghazi Khan's) ancestors, his genealogy, the circumstances of
his life and his victories. It was embellished with rhymed prose, metaphors, allegories, and all kinds of figures of speech. But before it could be copied it fell into the hands of the learned men (jUialä')of Bukhara who, out of envy, destroyed it, tearing to pieces every chapter, section by section and page by page (Firdaws al-iqbal, 1999, 61-62)

Ilbars Khan

- Opening: "Ilbars Khan was the son of Shah Niyaz Khan, but some think he was one of the Qazaq sultans.  Due to the efforts of Ish Muhammad Biy and Jum'a-Quli Ataliq, he mounted the throne of sovereignty in the Year of the Monkey, 1140 A.H. [i.e. 1727/28].  In his time, for eight years the country (yurt) enjoyed peace and quiet" (62).
- After putting down an internal rebellion, Ilbars goes a raiding in Khurasan: "After this, in the Year of the Hare, Ilbars Khan sent the Yomut Jiyen Vekil, with 3,000 Turkmens, in a raid against Khorasan.  They divided themselves into two parties; one went to the desert f Mane, the other - to the Aladagh and Semelqan region, which is the abode of the Chamishgezek Kurds.  They came and they were already in the midst of plundering, when the governors of those provinces arrived with Qizilbash troops, and a great battle took place.  Many people on both sides were killed.  Finally the Qizilbashes were defeated, and the ghazis, having returned with plentiful booty, attained [the honor or] kissing the [khan's] threshold.  At that time Nadir Shah had conquered Shamakhi wand was before Ganja" (63).
- "In 1150 A.H., the Year of the Horse, prince Riza-Quli Mirza, son of Nadir Shah, captured Balkh, and in Rabi' II set out for Mavarannahr.  Therefore the ruler (hakim) of Bukhara, Abu'l-Fayz Khan, and Hakim Ataliq asked Ilbars Khan and Ish Muhammad Biy for help.  They sent them a reinforcement of 1,000 men, and Ilbars Khan himself followed them with a big army.  The khan had not yet reached Bukhara, when the news came that the Qizilbash army in Qarshi had concluded peace with Abu'l-Fayz Khan and had turned back, and so the khan [also] returned" (63-64).
    - *Note that [[Astarābādī, Durrah-ʼi Nādirah]] says that Ilbars chickened out.*
- Minor scuffle between Khiva and Riza Quli "At the end of the Year of the Sheep, in the month of Zu'l-Qa'da 1151 A.H. [9 February - 10 March 1739], the khan left Ish Muhammad Biy in Khiva as his deputy, set out himself for Khorasan with the army of Uzbeks and Turkmens and arrived in Tezhen.  At that time Riza-Quli Mirza, having returned from his father in India, was in Herat.  He heard this news, and went with all possible speed to repulse [the enemies] and came to Sarakhs.  At that time Ilbars Khan already had advanced five farsakhs from Tezhen.  The scouts [qaravul] of both sides clashed, and the ghazis captured and brought three Qizilbashes from the enemy's army.  On hearing news about the prince from them, [the khan] considered it unwise to confront him, turned the reigns of departure in the direction of Amvar, besieged the fortress Qakhlan, which is between Nesa and Abivard, and was already close to capturing it.  Its governor (hakim), who was at that time in Abivard, heard the news and came from Abivard with troops for reconnaissance. The khan thought that it was the army of the prince, lifted the siege, plundered the environs and returned [to Khiva]" (64).
- Invasion of Nadir Shah: "In the Year of the Monkey, 1152 A.H. [1739/1740], Nadir Shah, after the conquest of Bukhara, moved off from the environs of Bukhara on Sunday 16 Rajab [6 October 1740], and on Thursday the 21st of the aforementioned month [11 October] he passed Charjuy, intending to conquer Khorezm.  On Monday 13 Sha'ban [2 November 1740] he reached Tive-Boyun.  Muhammad 'Ali Ushaq, who came with an army of Uzbeks and Turkmens, confronted him and was defeated.  On the 20th of the same month Ilbars Khan and Ish Muhammad Biy and all the amirs of Khorezm came to Hazarasp with innumerable army to repulse [the enemy]" (65).
    - "In the region of Pitnak they met [with the enemy] and joined battle.  However much they exerted themselves to kill the infidels, it was no avail.  Finally the Muslims were defeated and being unable to remain in Hazarasp, ensconced themselves in the city of Khanqah" (65).
        - Precise language here (165): و هر نیچه کیم جهد تمام بیله کفره نی قتل غه ییتکوردیلار یانا بیر طرفیغه خبر یتمایین یورماک اوضاعی غه تفاوت بولمادی آخر مسلمانلار شکست تاپید
    - (cont.) Nadir Shah pursued them and besieged the aforementioned city (balada).  The army of Islam fought well, but was defeated.  After seven days they were exhausted and left the fortress under the terms of a truce.  On Sunday the khan [also] left with the amirs.  On Tuesday the 27th of the same month, Nadir Shah put to death twenty amirs of Khorezm, with Ilbars Khan and Ish Muhammad Biy at their head" (65).
    - (cont.) Nadir is after slaves from his territory, just like the Russians: "At the beginning of the month of Ramazan Nadir Shah left Khanqah, laid siege to Khiva, erected the sarkubs [a siege tower] and started bombarding [the city].  From the pounding by the balls of muskets, cannons (tufang va top) and swivel guns (zanburak), most of the buildings were destroyed.  After three days, Dost Muhammad Arbab surrendered the city (qal'a) to the shah.  The shah stayed in the city for three more days.  He gathered all the captives, men and women, who, in accordance with the holy shari'a, had been enslaved in the land of Khorezm, and turned them over to their kinsmen and relatives.  In the same way he also took some Qalmaq and Russian slaves.  Among them all, the number of Khorasanian captives exceeded twelve thousand, and four thousand of them were from the royal capital Khiva.  He sent them to Khorasan, and, having built a fortress (hisar) at a distance of four farsakhs from Abivard, which called Khiveabad, he settled them there" (65).

Tahir Khan

- "He was the son of Vali Muhammad Khan, who was one of the paternal cousins of the khans of Mavarannahr.  When Nadir Shah was leaving, he put him on the khan's throne and left [some of] his own troops with him.  On 17 Ramazan [5 December 1740] he set out from Khiva and went back to Khorasan.  Tahir Khan ruled for six months.  He would cut of the ears and noses of offenders, and he used to promote Shi'a rites 
    - Wording (167): و گنه کار نینگ قولاق بورنینی کیستورور ایردی و شیعه رسومیغه رواج بیرور ایردی
- (cont.) Consequences: "Muhammad Mirab b. 'Ayd Mirab the Nokuz could not stand this tyranny, entered Kat, embarked on the path of hostility and unfurled the banner of resistance" (66).

Nur 'Ali Khan

- "Nur 'Ali Khan was a son of Abu'l-Khayr Khan... With the help of the people (khalq) of Qahraman, they entered the city, and for three months fought the Qizilbashes under Tahir Khan who had ensconced themselves in the citadel (ark).  Finally, having [penetrated] to the well by means of a mine and filled it with earth, they left [the besieged] to thirst and thus captured the citadel.  They dispatched Tahir Khan and the Uyghur Qutli Khan to hell, together with the Qizilbashes.  Having entered the citadel, Nur 'Ali Khan mounted the royal throne" (66).
- (cont.) Legitimating the rebellion by Nadir: "The same year Artuq Inaq went to Iran, met the prince Nasrallah Mirza in Merv [son of Nadir Shah], and submitted a written report describing the dishonor and oppression meted out by Tahir Khan, so that the prince was pleased with the killing of Tahir Khan.  With the permission of his father, the prince showered him with infinite favors and royal largesses, made Abu'l-Ghazi Sultan ibn Ilbars Khan a khan, entrused him to the inaq and sent [them to Khiva]" (66).
    - Bregel has an extensive footnote (370) recounting [[Kāẓim, ʻĀlam Ārā-yi Nādirī]]'s account of this episode.

Abu'l-Ghazi Khan II

- "His name was Abu'l-Muhammad Sultan. When Nadir Shah made him khan, he gave him the kunya Abu'l Ghazi" (67).
- Nadir changes de facto management of Khorezm: "In 1156 A.H. [1743-1744], the Chowdurs 'Ali Bay and Oraz Bay started hostilities, made an alliance with the Yomuts and conducted such a massive raid against Besh-Qal'a that nobody could venture out of his fortress (qurghan).  The calamity of famine spread.  Upon the advice of Abu'l-Ghazi Khan and Artuq Inaq, Muhammad Amin Mehter, one of the sons of Yarim Divan, went to Iran and reported these events to the shah.  to repulse the Turkmen rebels, Nadir Shah sent the great sipahsalar Fath 'Ali Khan ibn Ibrahim Khan, who was his own nephew, with 40,000 brave troops, to Khorezm, the dome of Islam, and sent Khuraz Bek with him, having handed authority over this country to him" (67).
- "In 1159 A.H., the Year of the Hare, Khuraz Bek went to Nadir Shah in Iraq.  In his absence, in the same year, Abu'l-Ghazi Khan put Artuq Inaq and Sayyid 'Ali Biy to death, together with their mother.  Khuraz Bek heard about this in Iraq, asked the shah to send Ghayib Sultan with him, and with the support of the shah, conquered Khorezm.  On hearing the news about the arrival of Khuraz Bek, the amirs of Khiva seized Abu'l-Ghazi Khan and detained him in the 'Arab Khan madrasa.  Khuraz Bek took him out of the madrasa and put him to a cruel death, in revenge for the blood of his elder brothers and mother" (67-68).
    - Footnote 378: "Both the sequence of events and their chronology given by Munis contradict those in the account of Muhammad Kazim (see previous note).  Khuraz Bek could not have gone to Nadir Shah in Iraq in either 1159/1746 (the Year of the Leopard) or 1160/177 (the Year of the Hare), because the shah was not in Iraq after 1156/1743.  More importantly, Muhammad Kazim participated in the expedition of 'Ali-Quli Khan to Khorezm himself, and his account should therefore be preferred.  It is possible that Khuraz Bek killed Abu'l-Ghazi Khan, indeed, in the Year of the Hare - 1160/1747, but it could have happened only *after* the murder of Nadir Shah on 10 Jumadi II / 30 June 1747 (similar to the killing of Abu'l-Fayz Khan in Bukhara by Muhammad Rahim Ataliq, which took place immediately after the death of Nadir)" (584).

Ghayib Khan

- "Ghayib Khan.  He is the son of Bahadur Khan. In his youth, he went from the Qazaqs to Bukhara, and when Nadir Shah conquered Mavarannahr, he entered his service.  He was with the shah's retinue in most of the battles and campaigns.  He came with Khuraz Bek, and in the same year... he was exalted with the crown of the Khorezmshahs" (68).
- Figurehead: "During his time the subjects (fuqara) enjoyed peace, and the affairs of the state were in the mighty grasp and at the powerful will of Khuraz Bek, and Ghayib Khan had nothing except the title [of khan].  Therefore the khan was very depressed" (68).
    - However, Khuraz Bek gets murdered, and Ghayib Khan gets to rule for real (69).
