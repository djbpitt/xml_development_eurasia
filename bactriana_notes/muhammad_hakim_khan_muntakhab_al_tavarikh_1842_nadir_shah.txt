p. 344. ذکر لشکر کشیدن نادر صاحب قران به صوب ماوراالناهر

- Nadir Shah goes to Turan himself with a massive army and ends up at Chor Bakr (چهار بکر).  
- So magnificent was Nadir's entourage that Abu al-Faiz and his amirs did not even know what to think or how to deal with this difficulty. Finally they wrote to a wise Ishan and asked him to visit Nadir.

p. 345.  @@very interesting passage@@: Nadir converts to Sunnism.  Also has anecdote about the foundation of the Bukharan madrasa in which the author studied.

- Nadir greeted the Ishan with full honors.  They became very close and spent the evening together.
- After this discussion Nadir returned to God (همان شب دست انابت داده) and returned to Sunnism (از مذهب تشیع بر گشت و مذهب اهل سنت و جمعات را اختیار نمود).
- Anecdote: Nadir is so pleased with the Ishan that he gives a jewel to him; but the Ishan gives it to his servant (ملا محمد شریف) instead.  The follower became a wealthy, globe-trotting merchant and founded a major madrasa in Bukhara.  بهترین مدرسهای بخارا است. 
    - This was also the madrasa which the author attended.
- The Ishan left and Abu al-Faiz went to Nadir's camp.  Nadir was very happy to meet Abu al-Faiz and greeted him with the amirs of Iran at attention.

p. 346

- Abu al-Faiz had a daughter of unmatched beauty.  This daughter Nadir took for himself and gave another one to his nephew
- Nadir Shah makes a number of changes, putting different amirs in different positions of power (including Rahim Khan of the Manghits), including relocating a number from Bukhara to Samarakand.  After that he "gifted" all of Mavrannahr to Abu al-Faiz Khan.
- Then he turned his sights on Khwarazm, conquering that as well.  The ruler there did not fare quite as well; Nadir had him killed.  He gave that khan's wife to Rahim.

p. 347.  Nadir returns to Iran.  The regicide.

- Upon Nadir's return to Iran, he began to suspect his son Riza Qoli and had him blinded (بر چشم... مِیل کشیدن

- According to the author he also orders people to abandon Shiism and convert to Sunnism.  Some converted, but most did not.
- At that time Nadir called a council outside of Mashhad.
- By this point the Amirs had become fed up with Nadir and decided to depose him.  Nadir was in his tent being serviced by a beautiful slave.  Then the slave noticed the killers approaching.  Nadir ignored her warnings and returned to sleep.

p. 348.  The slaying of Nadir Shah - presented as a tragedy by this author.

- Nadir cursed the slave girl attempting to warn him, blinded by pride and not believing that any in his own kingdom would move against him.
    - Nadir did not realize that the world is a cruel, unpredictable place: ندانسته بود که این فلک کجرفتار بسیار
- The murderers were 360 in number.
- Finally, Nadir drew his sword and leapt from the tent.  However, he tripped on a tent cord.  A killer cut off his head from behind.
    - Author's tone and terminology: از پشت شاه مملکت را قوی بود، به تیغ بیدادی به چندین خواری سر آن نادر دوران را از تن جدا کرد
        - (p. 349): آن شهنشاه آفاق به ناکامی شربت شهادت چشید

- All the Uzbek amirs assembled at Bukhara and determined that Abu al-Faiz was no longer fit to rule.  After that they all returned to their respective homelands.
