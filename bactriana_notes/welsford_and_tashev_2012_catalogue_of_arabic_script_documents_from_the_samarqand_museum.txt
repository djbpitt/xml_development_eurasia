## Thomas Welsford and Nouryaghdi Tashev, eds., A Catalogue of Arabic-Script Documents from the Samarqand Museum (Samarqand - Istanbul: International Institute for Central Asian Studies, 2012).

Original documents are available online: "The catalogue has been produced to complement an online digital archive of photographed document images produced by IICAS and maintained on the IICAS website www.unesco-iicas.org" (9).
 
Description of the collection and some statistics: "On the basis of our 848 textual descriptions, we may offer a few observations about the contours of the materials under discussion. 738 of our 848 texts, or 87.0% of the total number, are composed partly or wholly in Persian. 88 texts, or 10.3%, are composed partly or wholly in Turki; 49, or 5.9%, are composed partly or wholly in Arabic; and 4, or 0.5%, are composed partly or wholly in Russian. Of the total number of texts under discussion, meanwhile, 550 are dated by their authors to some degree of precision. Of these clearly dated texts, the earliest was composed between 12 December 1586 and 1 December 1587, and the latest was composed between 4 July and 1 August 1924. Just one such clearly dated text was produced in the 16th century: 5 were produced in the 17th century, 20 were produced in the 18th century, 310 were produced in the 19th century and 214 were produced after 1900. 124 texts, comprising 22.5% of all clearly dated items, were composed in the period before the Russian conquest of Samarqand in 1868; the remaining 426, or 77.5%, were composed thereafter. 488 texts, or 88.8%, were produced in the 50 years before or after the events of 1868; and 75 texts, or fully 13.5% of all clearly dated items, were produced in the years 1906-1909, the period for which we have the densest body of documentation"(10).
