"Sir, I do myself the honor to transmit, for information of the Right Honorable the Governor General of India "Memoir on the Uzbek State of Koondooz and the power of its presents ruler Meer Moorad Beg" by P.B. Lord Esq. the result of that gentleman's visit to Toorkistan."

__F. 1b__

"... be found to contain much novel matter while the political and military portion with W. Lords views as set forth, towards the conclusion, will, I believe, enable the Governor General to bring countries so important at this time, with great confidence into his Lordship's calculations."

"3 I take this opportunity also of note that when it appears advisable still further conciliate the chief of Koondooz, it can be ready by sending a reply to the letter he addressed to the Governor General by W. Lord, and which remains unanswered."

"I have the honor, Sir, your most obed. humble, Signed A. Burnes on special duty."

"Simla, the 31st July 1838"

#### "A Memoir on the Uzbek State of Kundooz and the power of its present ruler Mahomed Murad Beg" (f. 5)

__"Introduction" (f. 5)__

- On Kunduz's strategic position: "The geographical position of the State of Kundooz gives it an importance which it would not otherwise possess.  The passes of Hindoo Kosh, the direct roads commercial, as well as military from Toorkistan to Hindustan all lie within its limits, and its ruler has therefore equal power to assist or extinguish arising commerce, to expedite or retard an advancing enemy.  This renders it an object of interest to us to inquire into the origin, nature, and extent of the power of Mahomed Murad Beg the present Chief of Kundooz, to investigate the resources at his command, and, which should always be considered in speaking of Asiatic states, the probabilities of his transmitting them undivided to his successors" (5).

You are requested to apprize [Dr.] Lord that this document has given his Lordship an exceedingly high opinion of the zeal, ability, and industry of that Gentleman."
