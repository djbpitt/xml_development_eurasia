Majma' al-arqam: An Administrative Manual from Bukhara
Mirza Badi' Divan, written: 1798

- Editors' notes:
    - Written 1798, appendix added 1800-1801; author was one of the highest ranking administrators after the appointment of Amir Haydar (270).
    - "The list of ranks in the Bukharan Administration that is presented in the Majma' al-arqam should be treated with some caution, as it tends to present the different positions in an overly formulaic manner, disregarding contradictory information from other sources" (270).
    - Administration divided by four because of auspiciousness of the number: "In the words of the manual, there are four established forms of physical geography; the first rightly guided caliphs were four in number; there are four elements (earth, water, wind, and fire), four human tempers (phlegm, yellow bile, black bile, and blood), four seasons of the year, four cardinal directions, four types of precipitation (snow, rain, dew, and hail), and so forth" (270).
- Four high positions: 
    - 1 - Shaykh al-Islam; under him the Supreme Judge (qazi al-quzzat); under him the Military judge (qazi askar) (270).
    - 2 - The Muftis, the highest among them being a'lam; there is also a mufti askar to issue fatwas for the military (270-271).
    - 3 - Mukhtasibs.  "If there is no mukhtasib from among the sayyids, they allow someone from among the non-sayyids to supervise the people's observance of the shar'ia" (271).
    - 4 - The teachers (271).
- Four positions in the the amir's court:
    - 1 - "The first - the highest position - is entrusted to special representatives of the Juybari administration from inside and outside the city walls.  Sometimes sayyids are appointed to the position" (271).
    - 2 - Naqib - conditions, equipment, and allocation for military during war (271).
    - 3 - Uraq - has the duties of the mukhtasib in the military (271).
    - 4 - The Naqshbandi, in charge of administration, irrigation, and grounds for the [Baha' al-Din Naqshband] shrine (271).
- Four other positions: faizi, mir-i asad, sadr, sudur; former two in charge of mukhtasib duties outside of Bukhara; latter two in charge of waqf administration outside the city (271).
    - Sadr vs. Sudur: "The sadr manages registration of waqf inside Bukhara, and the sudur handles waqf registration outside the city" (271).
- Four bureaucratic positions: Divan-i Kalan - manages documentation; Mushrif - in charge of recording government inventory; Daftardar; Divan Tanabana handles land tax (271).
- Mentions someone in charge of "the affairs of the Arabs" (271).
- Other minor positions: "There are four other positions: First among them is the secretary (munshi), who writes the yarliqs and official documents.  The second is the arbab, who looks after the cleaning of canals... the third is the divan for the affairs of Arabs... and the fourth consists of different divans, handing bookkeeping and accounts.  There are four other, more minor positions: The librarian keeps treaties and looks after books.  The second is the bakhshi, who is in charge of expenditures of building activities; the third is the divan sayis khana, who is in charge of horses and stables; and the fourth, the divan tushak-khana, manages the store room and supplies" (271).
- Positions directly supporting the amir: "The next four positions are those who support the amir: First among them is the ataliq, which means **fatherhood** and so they call the [amir's] guardian.  The ataliq has to have the kind of relations with the sovereign as a father has with his son, and also has to treat the rest of the subjects in a similar manner.  He also handles water management of the rivers of Bukhara and sees that water is distributed as fairly as far as Samarqand and Qaraqul...  The second is the divanbegi, who manages the kharaj lands mu'azaf, and is in charge of revenues from all types of lands, and is also in charge of the officials of the chancellery. The third is the parvanachi, who issues the yarliqs for people of significance.  The fourth is the dadkhah, who receives all complaints and petitions, and the government's response to said petitions.  he is also in charge of corresondence with foreign rulers" (271-272).
