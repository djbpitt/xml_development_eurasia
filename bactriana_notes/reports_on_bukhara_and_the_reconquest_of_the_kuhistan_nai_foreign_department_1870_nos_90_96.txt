"No. 91.  From - F.B., dated Samarkand, 26th October 1869.  Policy towards Afghanistan" (p. 22)

- "On the 20th October, Mahomed Yusuf, son of Ibrahim merchant, was blown from a gun outside the Shah Zeridah gate in the presence of Russian troops, which were assembled on the parade ground for the occasion, for having assaulted a Russian officer.  His remains were afterwards interred" (22).
- Regional conquests: "On the 23rd of October news has been received to the effect that Khudayar Khan had taken Karatgen and expelled the Meer of Kulab from thence" (22).
- Shahrisabz: "Niaral Abramoff had sent a letter from the **Gubernator** Kauffmann to the Meer Jarah Beg, Ruler of Shahr-i-Sabz, inviting him to submit to the Russian Government, and in the event of his submission to come either in person or to send his heir-apparent to Samarkand to execute the necessary engagement.  In the event of the Ruler in question determining otherwise, he was requested to intimate his sentiments distinctly.  To-day Eshan Yahin Khoja, the Evoy [sic.], returned from Shahr-i-Sabz, and brought an answer to the effect that the Meer of Shahr-i-Sabz was not inclined to submit to the Russians, but that he was determined to fight.  The Niaral sent on the Envoy to the Gubernator" (22).
- (cont.) Bukhara setbacks in reconquering the Kohistan: "The Ameer of Bokhara is encamped with 17 guns at Karshi, and his General, Yacoob Beg, with 8,000 troops, at Khazar.  Yacoob Beg attacked Deb-i-Non, a dependency of Kulab, but was defeated, and has retreated to Khazar" (22).
- "On the 25th of October the Niaral wrote to the Ameer of Bokhara, observing that the Meer of Kulab had under him some Afghan soldiers, and requesting the Ameer to ascertain whether they were the Meer's own servants, or whether they had been lent to him by the Governor of Balkh" (23).
- "On the 5th of November, Eshan Yahya Khaja, Samarkandi, proceeded to Karshi accompanied by four Russians.  He has received a letter and a message for the Ameer of Bokhara, exhorting him to reduce Kulab and Hissar, and promising him assistance if required" (24).

"From - F.B., dated Karshi, 8th November 1869"

- "On the 30th October arrangements were made for the Gubernator's Durbar in the fort of Kohtsh, in the old Throne room of Taimur.  The Gubernator's chair was placed on a wooden throne raised about a foot from the ground, at the western and in the centre.  To the north and south of the throne seven and 10 chairs respectively were arranged for Russian officers.  Lower down chairs were placed on both sides for the Mahomedan Chiefs, and still lower down for the Hindus and Jews.  The entrance to the Durbar room was at the eastern end.  Two companies of Russian soldiers were arranged on the northern and southern sides of the room, and the band was in attendance.   By 10 o'clock the Durbaris had all been seated.  At 11 o'clock the Gubernator entered, attended by his  staff; all rose from their seats.  The Durbar arrangements were entrusted to the Niaral, the Mayor, and the Translator.  The following Chiefs were introduced in the order in which they are mentioned below: - 1. Abd-us-Samad, Mir Akbar, Bokhara Vakeel.  2. Eshan Kamal-ud-din, the City Kazi" (23)
    - (cont.): "The Gubernator shook hands with them.  The Chief who was introduced next was a Chief of the Kazalls; next followed Mornea Amin Officer Golava; after him were introduced the merchants of Samarkand, and next after them Haji Jan Mahomed, Vakeel of Sirdar Abdul Rahman Khan, the son of Ameer Afzul Khan, the late Ruler of Cabul.  After him was introduced Munshi Zahur Khan, formerly Kanungo of Tehseel Nowshahra in the Peshawur District, now Vakeel of the fictitious Feroze Shah Shahzada of Delhi.  After these followed the Jews and Hindus.  Nuzurs were then presented and accepted.  Khilluts were ordred to be given after the Durbar; afterwards the several Akskals who were seted on the ground paid their respects.  The Gubernator then addressed the Durbaris in Russian, which was translated by the interpreter, first in the Turkish, and afterwards in the Persian language" (23).
    - (cont.) "The Gubernator spoke as follows - 'The people of Samarkand will remember that when I first came to this place, I found them disobedient and inclined to be mischievous.  They were punished and their houses were burnt.  On the present occasion I have found them well behaved, and I am very glad to find them so.  I advise you never to swerve from allegiance to Russia, otherwise you will be destroyed" (24).
    - (cont.) "He then asked the merchants of Samarkand whether they were doing good business.  They replied in the affirmative.  He then said that they would not have to make long journeys, and merchandize would be brought to them at Samarkand itself.  He then turned to Jhisa Mul Chowdhri, Shikarpuri, and said - **You realize interest from your debtors without trouble.** He replied that by the kindness of the authorities his business was going on smoothly.  The Gubernator said - **Do not you molest others, and they will not molest you.** There were no Afghan or Peshawur merchants present at the Durbar.  I was present in the Durbar room and stood behind Mahomed Ali Tabrozi" (24).

"From - F.B., dated Karshi, 11th November 1869.  Policy towards Afghanistan"

- "Eshan Yahya Khoja, Interpreter, the Russian Envoy, who is at Karshi, mentioned to Kari Salah, at whose house I am residing, and who is the Ameer of Bokhara's Treasurer, that the Gubernator has determined to occupy both sides of the River Oxus, *i.e.* 1st, the city of Shahr-i-Sabz, and next Urganj, Kulab, and Hissar, which are close to Shahr-i-Sabz.  The Ameer of Bokhara intends to besiege those places.  In that case it is intended to occupy the eastern bank of the Oxus.  By occupying Urganj it appears to be intended to take within a curved line Bokhara, Karshi, and other villages of Bokhara to the bank of the Oxus..."
- (cont.): "The Russians intend to carry their boundary from Kulab and Hissar to Khiva.  The Gubernator is anxious that the Ameer of Bokhara may speedily conquer Kulab and Hissar, and @@in case of need he is prepared to render the Ameer assistance@@, as was done in the case of Karshi.  After the conquest of those places, the Ameer will be urged to lay siege to Shahr-i-Sabz, and aid will be lent him.  Afterwards the Russians will urge the Ameer to attack Khiva, fo rthey re themselves in an alliance with the Khan of Khiva.  In the middle of the current year the Russians desired the Khan of Khiva to reduce duty on merchandize, and to prohibit the sale of slaves, but they did not receive a satisfactory reply.  The Russians want to make a pretext for hostilities."
- "To-day (11th November) a caravan arrived from Bokhara at Karshi; 150 camel loads of Russian goods have gone for sale to Balkh, and 170 loads of silk for sale in India.  Mahomed Darvesh Bai, a Bokhara merchant, who has agents from Orenburg as far as Moscow, states that two thousand camel loads of silk and as many of cotton were taken from Bokhara and Kokan and sold at the Russian fair."

"No. 92.  From - F.B., dated Karshi, 26th November 1869"

- "you will have received and perused my paper of the 17th.  On the 21st November news arrived from the camp of the Ameer of Bokhara at Hisar Shadman to the effect that the people of Kulab told Meer Sarrah Beg that they would not fight against the Ameer, as they were afraid they would expose themselves to the same disasters as were suffered by the people of Karshi, whose houses were burned and plundered by the troops of the Ameer and the Russians.  This appears to be the effect of the presence of the Russian Officers in the Ameer's camp.  Meer Sarrah Beg then fled secretly at night across the Amayab in the direction of Kunduz, taking with him his family and property, and about twenty thousand families who had emigrated to Kulab from Kunduz during the rule of Afzal Khan.  These people having been supporters of Meer Sarrah Beg were afraid of being punished by the Ameer.  The people of Kulab wrote to the Ameer and begged him to send his officers, on whose arrival they made the country over to him."

- (cont.): "On the 22nd November an express messenger arrived at Karshi on his way to Samarkand, charged with the conveyance of a letter from the Ameer to the Russian General announcing the victory and success in Kulab.  The Durbar at Karshi has announced the flight of Abd-ul-Malik Tora, via Karatagin, to the Court of Yakub Kushbegi."
- "On 23rd November Nur-ud-Din Tora, the Governor of Karshi, received intelligence from the camp of the Ameer of Bokhara to the effect that the Ameer was at Kurghan Tippa, and that the Kulab rebels, notwithstanding their submission, had been imprisoned, and that it was intended to put some of them to death.  The Ameer, contrary to his former practice, now hesitates to kill human beings."
- (cont.) "On the 24th of November an express messenger from the Ameer's camp passed through Karshi on his way to Shahr-i-Sabz.  Kari Salah, on the authority of the Karshi Durbar, states that the Ameer has announced to the Meer of Shahr-i-Sabz his successes in Kulab and Hissar, and warned him that, after making all necessary arrangements for the administration of those territories, he (the Ameer) would turn his arms against the Meer."
