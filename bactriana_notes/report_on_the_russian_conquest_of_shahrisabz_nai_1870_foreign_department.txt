- Full report: "A Russian Officer, who was recently charged by General Kaufmann with a mission to Bokhara, has arrived here from Tashkend, and reports that previously to his departure a Russian force took possession of Sher-i-Sebz, as the Governor of that province had ceased to respect the authority of Bokhara and protected freebooters who molested the Russian frontier.  The Russian troops, however, retired immediately afterwards from the town and territory annexed to it, which were made over to the Ameer of Bokhara."
