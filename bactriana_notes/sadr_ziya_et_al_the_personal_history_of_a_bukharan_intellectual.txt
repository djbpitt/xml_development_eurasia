- The work in question (Editor's Note - Edward Alworth): "Dr. Rustam M. Shukurov, who teaches in the Faculty of History, Moscow State University, lists some of his most recent contributions to scholarship in the biographical section given below. In the present study, he translated from Persian or Tajik into English and annotated with great sensitivity and care both the basic manuscript text of the Diary (RÔznàma) and the extensive Introduction. Furthermore, his intimate knowledge about the life of his grandfather, Íadr-i Óiyà, confers special authenticity upon the Translator’s rendition of every page in this book" (xiii).
- Notes from the Project Director Shahrbanou Tadjbakhsh: "The project took almost ten years to bear fruit, from 1993 to 2002, a long process in search of reestablishing the links that were thought to have been broken when typhoid hit the madrasah of Sharifi-Ghaziyan (Mullà Muhammad-Sharìf madrasah in the quarter of ﬁàziyàn) turned prison during the purges of 1932 in Bukhara. During that period,  Sadr-i Ziya died, and his son was shipped off to live with his aunt, and then to Stalinabad, the capital of a new republic of Tajikistan. Sadr-i Zia’s personal Diary, together with his and the Amìr’s personal libraries, were sent to the Institute of Oriental Studies in Tashkent..." (xix).
    - Sadr-i Ziya was a patron of Aini, among others: "He used what we would call today his “good oﬃces,” his position, his own home, often his personal funds and his vast imagination, to create a venue for thinkers through literary salons at the end of the century. Later, as political events drove these thinkers into revolutionary action, he chose instead to devote his time to diligently recording the creations of poets, calligraphers, architects and politicians" (xxii).

Introduction by Muhammadjon Shakuri (Shukurov): "Sadr-i Ziya and his *Diary*"

- *Useful information, but Shukurov also spends a great deal of time defending the legacy of his father against the slander of other Jadids*
- Is this the definition of the Ulama?: "His name was sharif.  __Makhdum was the appelation given to offspring of the 'ulama__ (the intellectual, judicial and theological elite of Bukhara)... Sadr was the 'scholarly title which, in the last decades of the Amirate of Bukhara, was the highest in dignity in the third in order following after the inferior titles of uraq and sudur.  Ziya was his literary name" (1).
- Son of a merchant; sent to a madrassa when his talents were noticed (1).
- Majlises: "We learn from Sadr. al-Din-i 'Ayni that every week **on school holidays, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, the house of Sharif-jan Makhdum turned into a gatehring place of poets, devotees of poesy, tellers of entertaining anrratives and wits**" (2).
- Sadr Ziya was a student and admirer of Ahmad Danish, another 19th century luminary (4).
- Relationship with Jadidism: "Sharif-jan Makhdum never took direct part in the Jadid movement, yet the Jadids always benefited from his moral and material support and assistance" (5).
- Amir issues reform manifesto 17 April 1917: "On the 8th (21st) of April, progressivists organized a “demonstration of gratitude” throughout the city. As demonstrators progressed toward the Règistàn, where the Ark was situated, they were surrounded by students and mullahs, conservative opponents to the reforms. The Amìr’s soldiers then dispersed the demonstrators and arrested a number of the Jadìds. Pressure increased, and the eﬀect of the Reform Manifesto, having not become operational yet, was reduced" (10).
    - "Thus, the post of Sharif-jan Makhdum-i Sadr-i Ziya as Chief Justice lasted only for ﬁfteen days, from March 26 to April 9 1917 (or from the 8th to 22nd of April according to Gregorian calendar). In the history of the Bukharan Amirate, we can hardly  ﬁnd any other person who served such a short term in this position" (12).
- Died in a madrassa turned into a prison: "The prison was located in the madrasah of Mullah Muhammad-Sharif (in the quarter of Ghaziyan) and this was the name of Sadri-i Ziya himself" (15).
- Possible major souce: "For example [of one of his many works], one of his roughts, which is kept as Number 2367 in the Collection of the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Academy of Sciences in Tashkent, contains much information on his schoolmates, on the visit of the Amir of Bukhara to Russia, about the relations between Bukhara and Afghanistan, samples of his own letters and applications... consisting of more than 60 stories" (17).
- Bukharan Enlightenment in caps, huh?  "Sady-i Ziya was one of those writers of the Bukharan Enlightenment who contributed to the beginning of the foundation of the national Tajik literature" (18).
    - Tajik nationalism: "Writers began to pay more attention to national and social realities, their speciﬁc concerns and their local peculiarities, to those traits which diﬀerentiated the speciﬁc experience of the Tajik people from that of Persian-speakers of othercountries, Afghanistan and Iran. The general humanistic approach of literature, a common feature for Persian-speaking literature, did not decrease, but the speciﬁc Tajik national and local color and characteristics increased. Until then, the Persian-speaking literature of Mawarannahr par excellence was Persian literature; it became Persian Tajik literature from then on" (18-19).
    - More on the so-called Enlightenment: "The Bukharan Enlightenment was an ideology of national revival. The agents of Enlightenment hoped to achieve the revival by means of uplifting culture (in a general sense) and spirituality, being sure that ediﬁcation and general cultural betterment would lead the coun-try to spiritual revival (37).
- Lists most of Zia's various works on p. 21.
- Zia's objective: "The main reason why he would turn to history was his search for the ideal of the just king and the prudent minister.  He wanted to define the ideal characteristics of kings and ministers and their rule, in order to be taken into account in the social and political reforms of the day" (22).
    - Zia had biographies of the poets as well (22).
        - one was published in Iran: Sharif-jan Makhdum-i Sadr-i Ziya, Tazkar-i ash'ar.  Sharh=i hal-i barkhiaz sha'iran-i mu'asir-i Tajikistan wa namunahayi az shi'r anan, ba tashih-i Sahab al-Din-i Siddiq (Tehran, "Soroush Press", 1380/2002) (23).
- Check out some of these sources: Zikr-i chand nafar 'ulama-i dawr-i akhir (On some 'ulama of the Last Epoch); other great citations on this page (24).
    - Also (!): Zikr-i asam-i madaris-i dakhila-i Bukhara-i Sharif (On the Madrasahs, Located in Noble Bukhara).  No. 2193XIII at Biruni. 400 pages.
        - "Sadr-i Ziya mentioned two hundred and four madrasahs, with an indication of their location in the city. His mentioning the number of cells is also important because it shows the size and capacity of a madrasah. On the basis of Sadr-i Ziya’s list one may learn that the biggest madrasahs had up to one hundred and forty-seven cells (such as, for instance, the famous Kulkaltash madrasah), while the smallest ones had only eight or nine cells; some madrasahs had only two cells (such as Mehtar 'Àrif madrasah). The number of those madrasahs which had more than twenty cells added up to sixty; twenty madrasahs had more than  ﬁfty cells. In the last column of the table the author gave the name of a person who built the madrasah, the year of construction or the name of the Bukharan Amìr during whose reign the madrasah was build" (27).
- Aini's unabridged Yaddashtha consists of about four volumes and 1000 pages (25).
- Timespan of the diary: 1306/1929 - 1348/1929 (30).
- Gaps in Zia's account: "Why did Sadr-i Zia dedicate about twenty pages of his diary and plenty of details to the Russian-Japanese War, while completely neglecting in some sense the heroic ﬁght of Tajik intellectuals of the Enlightenment who brought Bukhara out of backwardness?" (34).
    - "Completely ignor-ing such notable events as the emergence of new method schools, publishing of the new text-books and ﬁrst liberal newspaper, starting of anti-Jadìd persecutions by the authorities and the like..." (36).
- Jadids vs. Qadimis: Jadids led by Mufti Ikram / Mulla Ikramcha (1847-1925); Qadimis led by qazi Burhan al-Din, Bukharan chief Justice (37).
- Zia followed Danish's example: "Ahmad-i Danish and his followers opened their eyes, seeking for an exemplar, to the order of life, in other coun-tries and nations, which they compared with the habits of their home-land" (39).
- Stance towards colonialism and the Amir of Bukhara: "It is clear that the writer’s tonality in regard to both oppressing colonizers and those who failed to defend the nation against oppres-sors is very sharp. This was also a broad hint to the Bukharan amirs who had been unable to defend their nation and country" (44).
- Shukuri considers Zia a man of the "Central Asian Enlightenment" (46).
