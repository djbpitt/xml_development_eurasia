This is quite true.  Issue orders at once that the slaughter-house should be removed to a long distance from the city, and that the place should be cleaned.

The epidemic is not of a very virulent type, and the number of deaths is only about ten a day, but the proceedings of the Russian doctors have greatly alarmed the people, who have run away in different directions.  The population of Ashkhabad has been reduced by about one-half.  If a person complains of even a headache he is at once carried off, by force, to the hospital where the Russian doctors administer to him a dose of poison, which kills him within half an hour.  This measure, it is said, is adopted to prevent the spread of cholera.  All dead bodies are burried [sic.[ without shrouds or coffins with the clothes of the deceased on them, in deep holes dug in the ground which are filled with lime.  Muhammadans are not allowed to inter their dead in accordance with the ceremonies and laws laid down by their religion. This hurts their feelings considerably and is causing great discontent, but the people are helpless" (1-2).
