- "My movements of late have been been guided solely by my zeal in the service of the British Government. With regard to the affairs of Bulkh, I had obtained possession of that City, although I knew that it was a morsel for me to devour, yet the affair was finished, the Army of the King of Bokhara which had arrived at [Mudluns], had retired in disappointment and had [recrossed] the Oxus, the inhabitants of the Country, rich & poor, were enjoying peace and happiness and [praying] for the prosperity of his Majesty Shah Shoojah and the British Government" (5).
- (cont.) "The respectable Khajeh Nukeeb, who formerly was Governor of Bulkh but having been removed from that Office has been for some time past residing at Bokhara, has in consequence of late occurrences been sent as Governor of Akcheh" (5).
- "Now that I have received your commands to the effect that the British Government is on terms of peace and amity with the King of Bokhara, and requires me to make peace with that monarch, I have sent for the above mentioned Khojeh Nukeeb and the [Behee?] of the King of Bokhara, and have made over to them the four forts, namely, [Chehl Guzzee (the Citadel of Bulkh), Mukhluns, Douluhabad, and Chooehik].  Of these four they have restored to me the fort of [Dowlhhabad] which I have garrisoned with my own people

- "Your former proceeding in attacking Bulkh and bringing down upon yourself the enmity of the ruler of Bokhara was not sanctioned either by His Majesty or the British Government and was not therefore agreeable to either" (7).
- "I now am satisfied that your former proceeding was really undertaken with a view to the benefit of His Majesty and the British Government" (7).
- "I take this opportunity of acquainting you that Major [Pottinger] the gallant defender of Herat against the Persians has been appointed by His Majesty to fill the place of the lamented [Dr. Sord?].  I trust that you will occasionally favor him with your correspondence" (8).
