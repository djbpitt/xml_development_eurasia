Continued from: [[Muḥammad Ḥakīm Khān, Muntakhab al-Tavārīkh 1842: Rahim Khan through Shah Murad]]

#### Amir Haydar
387

- Haydar was suspicious of his brother, Nasir Khan, who was governor of Merv but fled to Iran as he was close with فتح علی شاه قاچار.  Fath Ali Shah appointed him governor of مشهد
    - *interesting how close these dynasties are*
- Another brother, محمد حسین خان, who governed Samarkand, also feared for his safety, and simply fled to the perpetually subversive نیاز علی والنعمی of Shahrisabz, where he was greeted warmly; even gave Muhammad Husain his own sister to marry.
388. Another failure to take Shahrisabz

- Haydar's first move was to move on Hisar, which was effectively an independent state (سر به هیج صاحب دولتی فرود نمی آورد); he emerged victorious and humiliated and decapitated its ruler (به چندین خاری سر آن را از تن پاک ساخت).  Then he put سید اتالیق یوز in power as governor.
- -@@Aside@@- Hisar (EI, Spuler): Called Shuman [شومان] at the time of the Arab conquests and was a small independent principality until it came under the ruler of the Chaghaniyan; unruly even in that time, which was troublesome since it was considered the last bulwark against the encroaching Turks; name changed to Hisar-i Shadman [حصار شادمان] in the Timurid period.
    - "After the collapse of the Shaybanids Hisar fell into the hands of the Turkmen tribe of Yuz and - like four other begliks - was able to maintain what was to all intents and purposes an independent position in relation to the Amirs of Bukhara.  Only after the Russian conuest of Bukhara in 1868 was the town and its hinterland really subject to the Amirs." Hisar is now in the territory of Tajikistan.
- Next Haydar marched on Sahrisabz, but the دیوان بیگی got wind of their approach and met Shahrisabz met them in battle; the battle was ferocious, but ultimately Haydar was forced to make peace and return to Bukhara.
    - *No one can ever keep Shahrisabz down*
389. Personal feud and Uratipa

- To summarize, the elder son of the governor of Uratipa was inexperienced and in with the wrong crowd and pissed off his uncle, who then killed him.  This caused Haydar to march on Uratipa.
390

- The governor of Uratipa made peace without incident, and Haydar ruled that the son of the slain adviser be granted قصاص on the uncle that murdered him.
- Uratipa, unlike Shahrsabz, is ultimately controlled by Haydar: تمام توابعات اوراتیچه را در قبضۀ اقتدار خود در آورد
- Interesting passage (which flows onto p 391) immediately after author records the subjugation of Uratipa: حکومت آن بلده را به ملا ایر نظر بی منقیت وا گذشت و بسیاری امرزادهای بخارا مثل اکای حکیم قوش بیگی محمد قابل بی اناق و بیکمراد پروانچی و امثال اینها از @@تاجیک و اوزبک@@ قریب جهار هزار کس جرار را در آن ملک تعیین نمود و خود متوجه بخارا شد
    - So there is definitely a Uzbek-Tajik dichotomy; those terms mean something in the 19th century, even if they are not as rigid as under the Soviets.
    - Haydar controls Uratipa so well that he can fire the old governor and install a Manghit.
    - All of the luminaries of this city went to Bukhara.
391. Khwarazm attempts to conquer Turkestan

- ایل توزر خان of Khwarazm fancied himself ruler of all Turkestan and marched on Bukhara.
392

- Also worth noting that in the mind of the author the amirs are a fairly distinct group; he refers to them as such in his battle descriptions, the امرا بخارا
- Ail Tuzar Khan attempts to escape on a boat, but his men drag him to his watery death in a panic.
393. Balance of Power in Mawaranahr

- That very day 5 fortresses of Urgench offered the khotba to Amir Haydar.
- The amirs of Bukhara wished to permanently conquer Khiva, *but* عالیجاهی امیر عالم خان was at that time marching on Uratipa with the army of Farghana; he succeeded, taking a number of princes and 4000 prisoners.
- Hence the amirs of Bukhara were forced to give up the conquest of Khwarazm when they were on the verge of victory.
394

- But Alim Khan did not really engage the Bukharan forces; he returned to Khoqand.
396

- About this time شاه زمان visits Bukhara from Kabul.
397. On the Afghans

- At this point Hakim Khan devotes a few pages to the Afghans.  The categories he uses are interesting.  He clearly sees the Afghans as a people separate from the Uzbeks, of which the latter there are two kingdoms - Khoqand and Bukhara.  
    - Nevertheless, like Rahim Khan, he emphasizes that in the time of Nadir all were subordinate to him: مجمل سخن آن که چون واقعۀ نادر شاه صاحبقران روی داد، همۀ امرا به جای خود رفتند.  در آن میان احمد خان افغان که از جماعۀ صدوزهی بود  اودَچی نادر بود
    - Also, Hakim Khan is certainly aware of the different Pashtun tribes, mentioning the صدوزهی and the بارکزهی
- Author relates an anecdote about Ahmad Khan meeting a dervish who whacks him, but Ahmad and a prince of Kabul show restraint and are rewarded with a blessing.
398

- Ahmad Shah in that moment with the dervish achieved religious certainty and gained the right to rule the world: احمد شاه نقل میکرده است که "همان ساعت یقینم شد که بر بمام ربع مسکون فرمان روا گشتم"
400

- Relates a story about two stones of rulership, one kept by Fath Ali Shah in Tehran, and the other by Afghan rulers.
- Author is a big fan of Amir Dost Muhammad, and personally traveled to Afghanistan and was friends with Dost Muhammad; mentions that his enemy Shah Shujah was on the British teat: ... و دوست محمد خان امیری بود، صاحب تدبیر و شجاع و دانا.  فقیر بسیار ولایت را دیدم و بسیار پادشاهان ذوی الاحترام را در صحبت شان راه یافتم. مثل برادرم امیر دوست محمد خان را ندیدم و نشنیدم و در عصر امیر دوست محمد خان شجاع سه درجه به مدد فرنگی لشکر جمع کرده آمد و محاربات سخت در میان ایشان واقع شد و شکست خورده...
401

- In any case, after being blinded زمان شاه shows up in Bukhara for permanent residence. Amir Haydar of course greets him warmly, but then hears about Zaman Shah's daughter behind kept behind the cover of the haram.  Haydar offers to marry the daughter, but the response is not positive: حکیم خان: حیدر پادشاه مطلع گشته، از برای خواستگاری کسی به نزد شاه زمان فرستاد و شاه از این خبر بر آشفت و گفت، "ما و شان هم کفو نیستیم و هم در ولایت شان مسافر افتادیم. از این امر ما را معذور دارند." از جواب شاه غضب بر طبیعت میر حیدر پادشاه مستولی شد
    - In other words, we are not alike, you and I, and we are oathbound to be mere travelers in this land and one day return to Afghanistan.
- Haydar took the daughter anyway and branded Zaman, sending him to the house of God: به رجر آن پرده نشین حرم را در عقد خود در آورد و آن شاه بی سر و سامان به چندین داغ حسرت متوجه بیت الله گشت
    -*check into this - based on Wikipedia this is not his ultimate fate as it has come down into history*
- In the year 1225 Khoqandi امیر عالم خان died and was replaced by عمر خان
402.  War between Khoqand and Bukhara.

- Meanwhile, سیادت پناهی محمود خان steals something from Haydar and seeks refuge with عمر خان.
- In retalation, Haydar takes his army to the fortress of پشاغر.
- The author's brother خدایار بی والنعمی (who I *think* was the second son of the late عالم khan of Khoqand) manages to get the news to Omar Khan, who in turn came to war.
- Though no more than three farsangs were left between the two armies, Haydar flees to Bukhara.
- Omar Khan takes the fortress without seeing a trace of Haydar.
    - A Khoqandi poet wrote of Haydar's retreat: پی هست حیدر نیست
- Note the language that Hakim Khan uses here - __there were many more than three emirates__.  در آن عصر در شهر سبز نیاز علی والنعمی نیز وفات یافت. به جای او فرزند ارشدش محمد صادق بی دیوان بیگی بر شهر سبز در مسند امارت نشست و در شرِ کتاب برادرش دانیال بی در __امارت__ نشست و مادر این دو __امارت پناهان__... 
403. Haydar's unsuccessful attempt to take shahrisabz and Kitab

- The two aforementioned brothers fought a succession war, and Haydar immediately moves in to take advantage.
- At his approach the two brothers made peace with one another.
- Haydar could either not countenance the casualties or perhaps fell sick (به تنگ آمد) and returned to Bukhara.
- *Here the status of the Amir of Shahrisabz is even less ambiguous* - ... و محمد صادق بی بر سریر امارت نشست و گویند، در میان میران کینگس مثال او شجاع و با همت نگذشته است...
404.  Tale of the Cow

- At this point Hakim Khan comes up with a fairly bizarre story, though an illustrative one.  One day the amir of Shahrisabz (I think...) is going to Kitab.  On the way he asks a random guy in Persian what the name of his cow is, but the guy was Uzbek and hence did not understand.  The Amir became angry and the cow-owner confused.  Eventually the Amir whipped the man.
    - *Intersting that an Uzbek Amir cannot even speak Turkish*
    - The story itself: روزی از شهر به کتاب می آمد. کسی از بازار گاوی ابلق خریده بود.  میر پرسید که "نام گاوت چیست؟" آن اوزبک بیچاره نمیدانست که چه گویدو  میر تا رفت، مبالغه میکرد.  صاحب گاو بسیار گرنگ شد.  نمی فهمید که مدعای میر چیست و خود میر هم نمیدانست که چه میپرسد. بالآخیر میر در غضب شد و در تحت تازیانه گرفت.  آن بیچاره به زبان ترکی میگفت "هوکوزومنی آتی هوکوز و رنگی الا." و به هر جانب میگریخت.  عاقبت یکی از ندیمان او فهمید که مدعا چیست.  به صاحب گاو گفت "میر از تو بهای گاو را میپرسید." بعد میر هم دانست که غلط کرده بوده است و صاحب گاو هم دانست که این گاوی از خودش شده بوده است.  از این نوع سخنهای بیهوده بسیار است
- Hakim Khan relays that he has limited information on the Shahrisabz emirate after this; it was inherited by two boys that spent most of their time engaged in wine and little boys: به خوردن می ناب و ساقیان گل اندام مشغول گشتند
405

- In 1233 دانیال پروانچی swoops in to Shahrisabz and takes over the emirate.
405. Author's brother's exploits - ذکر مقدمۀ دولت برادرم محمد رحیم بیگی

- Such a Persianate reference comparing a vicious battle to one from the Shahnama: چنان جنگی بر پا کردند که جنگ رستم و اسفندیار از دفترها محو شد
- *This section is somewhat confusing to me because Hakim Khan's brother is clearly fighting against Khoqand... but I thought he was a part of that Khanate*
- Rahim Divan Begi first takes the fortress پشاغر then یال.
407

- In the end Muhammad Rahim Begi is victorious and sets up a __hereditary__ begstvo in Uratipa: چون محمد رحیم دیوان بیگی به ملک موروثی بر مسند امارت نشست و تمام توابعات آن ولایت را در تحت تصرف خود در آورد، به قبض بسط ولایت پرداخت

407. ذکر مقدمۀ زوال دولت امیر حیدر پادشاه و یاغی شدن جماعۀ خطای قپچاق و مردم میان کال

- The beginning of the fall of Haydar's government began in 1238 and the zenith of his sultanate came to an end (اوج سلطنت به سر آمد) and the realm erupted into general chaos.
    - Note that he uses the term ولایت to describe Haydar's realm; this paltry term may not be an accident.
- The fearless (در میان اوزبک از وی بیباک تر مردم نمیاباشد) Qipchaq tribes (جماعۀ خطای قپچاق) were the cause of the chaos.
- It all started with the hakim of Samarkand (دولت قوش بیگی حاکم ثمرقند) went to a fortress (قلعۀ ینگی قورغان) for the wedding (طوی) of his nephew (شکور بی).
408

- A watchman (پاسی) led the Qipchaq to Samarkand and they plundered the treasury (مال و اموال) and abducted the hakim's wife and child and imprisoned the hakim himself ignomoniously (بی آبرویی).
- عمر خان (amir of Khoqand) took this opportunity to siege the fortress of Jizakh (جیزخ).  This prompted the Qipchaq to make entreaties to Khoqand, and the two lavished gifts upon each other.
- Meanwhile محمد رحیم خان خارزمی gets in on the action and also attacks Bukhara, looting and pillaging (though it does not say he made it into the city).  He also took hostages: گویند، دوازده هزار خانه وار را کوچ از تُمن بخارا برده بود
409. The burning of Bukhara

- The fighting was pretty vicious; the Khwarazmis were cutting off the ears of their victims: (quote continued from previous page): غیر از به قتل رسیده گی به هر جا که میرسید، یک گوش ایشان را بریده میبرد و خود او را وا میگذارید. در آن وقت بسیاری مردم صحرای بخارا بی گوش بودند
- Then the Khwarezmis went to the gates of Bukhara and set the city on fire; it was an unprecedented tragedy: تنگی ولایت از این زیاده نمی باشد
- Shahrisabz also decides to take advantage of the situation: و از جانب شهر سبز دانیال اتالیق سواری نموده، چند قورغان امیر حیدر پادشاه را او نیز در تحت تصرف در آورد و حیدر پادشاه حیران و سراسیمه بود که  به چه تدبیر آتش فتنه را فرو نشاند و به هیچ اندیشه علاج پذیر نبود
- Finally, when Haydar hears that the Khwarazmis are pillaging غجدوان he sends رجب دیوان بیگی at the head of an army to face his enemy.
410

- The Bukharan army was defeated by Khwarezm fairly decisively.
    - Described in [[Munis Khorezmii, Firdaws Al-Iqbāl]] 496-497.
- Haydar got depressed, but then ended up taking an army (taking half of the amirs with him and leaving the other half in Bukhara) to Samarkand, where he managed to drive away the Qipchaqs and Khoqandis.
- Once Haydar arrived in Samarkand, a bunch of amirs from the surrounding provinces came to him, hungering for battle.
411

- However, the amirs could not achieve victory and were forced to return to Samarkand.
- Haydar hands the reigns of Samarkand over to his son (امیر حسین توره) and heads back to Bukhara.
- About that time news arrived to Bukhara of the death of عالیجاهی امیر عمر خان and the succession of محمد علی خان غازی to the throne of Khoqand; Amir Haydar and Ghazi became close friends.  
412

- They sent esteemed embassadors to one another: و ایلجیان دانا رفت و آی کردند (Haydar may have been physically at Khoqand visiting, but it is unclear).
- Haydar suspects his son امیر حسین توره and deposes him.
- Defection: Haydar gets sick of Ghazi (امیر حیدر به دل پر از محمد علی خان), and one of his men goes over to Ghazi's side: در آن وقت محمد رحیم دیوان بیگی از میر حیدر پادشاه روی گردان شده، به محمد علی خان طرح آشنایی انداخته بود
    - This defection prompts Haydar to go to war with the Qipchaqs, who (p. 408) were allied with Khoqand.
412

- Previously, Haydar had sent an envoy (عصمت الله بی) to Khoqand, who was accepted with honor. On their way to Tashkent they encountered Haydar's siege of the Qipchaq fortress and begged him to spare them.
- The Qipchags returned to their people and troubled Haydar no longer and pledged themselves to his service: از فتنۀ خطای قپچاق امیر حیدر خلاص شد
414

- About this time news from اورگنچ arrives that محمد رحیم خان died and was succeeded by his son رشید الله قلی خان.  His brother رحمان قلی اِناق had a thousand horses (and presumably contested his brother's succession, which made Haydar happy.
415

- Lots of confusing proper nouns here, but the gist of it is that one of the losers from the succession struggle ends up working both for the Qajars and the Ottomans.  Even some travel to Russia, and eventually ends up in Bukhara.  There is a world of Turkic nobility at work here.
416.  Death of Amir Haydar

- Memories of Haydar and his pious learning: گوید، در میان پادشاهان اوزبک میل امیر حیدر پادشاه با حوصله و عالم حق شناس نگذشته، چنانچه گویند، هر روز چهار صد کس در پیش او درس میخواندند زیاده از هزار به حلقۀ درس حاضر می شدند
    - Also, he was a Hafiz; also, he had completed the Sufi path: عمرش از چهل گذشته بود که حافظ کلام الله شد و از چند پیر کالم خط ارشاد گرفته، سلوک را تمام کرده بود
