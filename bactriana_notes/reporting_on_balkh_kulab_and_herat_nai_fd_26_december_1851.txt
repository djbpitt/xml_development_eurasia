- Capture of Balkh: "The Ameer has reduced the country from Balkh to [Minhet] and [Akhdish?] [marginal note - 'Two places west of Bulkh...].  Sirdar Mahamud Arkim Khan is in Bulkh, and Sirdar Mohamud Shureef Khan in Tash Kurghan.  Those men who opposed the Sirdars have been sent in captivity with their wives and property to Cabul" (5).
- Bukhara and Shahrisabz: "The King of Bokharah has attacked the King of Shuhurisubz but has not yet succeeded in taking that place" (6).
- (cont.) Kulab: "The meer Kolab, whose name was Meer [Mizrab], is dead; his Brother, Meer Kumchee Khan, has succeeded him, and the Meer of Shiburghan is also dead and his palace is occupied by his son in law.  The Meers of Kolab and Shiberghan are both in open opposition to the Dost's Sons in Bulkh: from the fact of this being distant and no communication having passed between them" (6).
- Situation in herat: "... news had been received that the younger Son of Yar Mohummud, who is quite a boy  (but who is the only heir fit to occupy his Father's place, from the fact of his older Brother bing mentally incompetent to hold the task of Government) had put 18 of the head men of Herat to death.  These nobles were inviting strangers from all sides to come and take possession of Herat..." (8).
