- On Kashmir: "This region is mountainous and one of the most beautiful parts of the world. It is called “India’s Paradise.” Its latitude and longitude are 34 degrees 30 minutes north and 74 degrees 45 minutes east. In former times it was under the sway of the Mughal sultans and was considered part of India. Later, His Highness Ahmad Shah Durrani occupied it. It remained under the control of Afghan sovereigns and leaders until the death in 1238/1822-23 of Sardar Muhammad fiAzim Khan, the brother of the late Amir Dust Muhammad Khan. After his death, Maharajah Ranjit Singh seized it. At the end of the reign of his son, Maharajah Vilip Singh, it passed into the hands of Maharajah Gulab Singh of the Dugrah clan. Now the chieftainship of that region, subject to the English government, belongs to Maharajah Partab Singh, a grandson of Maharajah Gulab Singh. The population of the region is approximately 180,000." (7).
- During Ahmad Shah's fourth campaign to Lahore in 1165/1752: "In the meantime, while these events were taking place between the Mufiin al- Mulk’s family and the notables of Lahore, Ahmad Shah Durrani ordered Ishik Aqasi fiAbd Allah Khan, to conquer Kashmir. Having removed Kashmir from the hands of the officials of fiAlamgir II, he left (another) fiAbd Allah Khan, known as the “little khwajah,” with a garrison in Kashmir as governor. A certain Sakjiyun of the K(h)atri people, Hindus of Kabul, was put in charge of financial affairs in Kashmir. Formerly, Sakjiyun had been in the employ of the wazir, Shah Wali Khan, and Ahmad Shah had sent him to collect funds from Mufiin al-Mulk, the subahdar of Lahore, a service he had performed well." (21).
    - Conquest impermanent (but Ahmad Shah leads another campaign in 1170): "Moreover, Sakjiyun, the fiscal officer of Kashmir, seeing Lahore lost to the officials of the Afghan state, raised the head of insolence to the point of sedition, and had the commander of the Afghan garrison killed. He (also) imprisoned the “little khwajah”, the governor of Kashmir, and then drove him out of the region. Then by sending some gold to Mir Shihab al-Din fiImad al-Mulk, he obtained a decree from fiAlamgir II conferring on him the subahdarship of Kashmir. The coin insignia and the Friday sermon invocation /18/ were (now) performed in (fiAlamgir’s) name." (22).
- This fifth campaign on Lahore in 1170 was successful: "A great deal of booty fell into their hands and a tremendous victory was won. Ahmad Shah marched back to Lahore on the seventh of Shafiban 1175/3 March 1762. From there he dispatched Nur al-Din Khan, the cousin of Shah Wali Khan, to Kashmir with a force of Durrani, Qizilbash, and Khurasani troops to suppress Sakjiyun for whom Ahmad Shah had done many favors, as noted above. The shah, meanwhile, occupied himself with the administrative affairs of Lahore." (33).
    - "When Sakjiyun learned that a force had been sent against him, he looked to the mountain ranges and hilltops as his allies and, alternately confident and nervous, he took up defensive positions. Meanwhile Durrani and other Afghan stalwarts drew near and both sides opened fire. The fight went on until most of the Kashmiris had had a taste of Afghan steel. Those who survived fled in panic with the Durranis in pursuit. During the battle, Sakjiyun and a group of men with him /27/ put up a fierce fight but eventually had to quit the field. They and their families were captured and the Afghans occupied Kashmir. By proclamation Ahmad Shah conferred its government on Nur al- Din Khan who had won the day. After completing administrative matters relating to Lahore and Kashmir and their respective territories, the shah returned to Qandahar where he rested." (33).
