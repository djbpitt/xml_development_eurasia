The Archive

- Allegedly his notes should have some data on the prices he paid for the various materials he picked up for the museum, which might come in handy some day (see Ivanov, “Spiski rukopisei Bukharskoi kollektsii,” in Pis'mennye pamiatniki Vostoka (St. Petersburg, 1970).
    - This is probably in the section Spiski rukopisei, delo 10-15.
